18996365	Title	Detection of miR-106a in gastric carcinoma and its clinical significance.
18996365	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in carcinogenesis. miRNA-106a (miR-106a) has oncogenic activity in humans, and often has altered expression. The clinical significance of miR-106a in the diagnosis of gastric carcinoma is poorly understood. The level of miR-106a in 55 gastric carcinoma and 17 non-tumor tissues was quantified by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and the relationship between miR-106a level and clinical and pathological factors was explored. The level of miR-106a in cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in non-tumor tissues, with an average 1.625-fold increase. miR-106a level was significantly associated with tumor stage, size and differentiation; lymphatic and distant metastasis; and invasion (P<0.01). The altered expression of miR-106a was confirmed in gastric cancer cell lines. miR-106a may be a potential biomarker in the diagnosis of gastric carcinoma.

19439999	Title	Decreased expression of microRNA-143 and -145 in human gastric cancers.
19439999	Abstract	Downregulation of specific microRNAs (miRNAs) occurs in human tumors, which suggests a function for miRNAs in tumor suppression. We investigated the role of the miRNAs miR-143 and miR-145 in gastric cancers. The expression levels of miR-143 and miR-145 in the samples from 43 patients with gastric cancer were determined by real-time PCR using TaqMan assay. The growth inhibitory effect was estimated by the transfection of human gastric cancer cells with the miRNA. The expression levels of miR-143 and -145 were decreased in most human gastric cancers examined, as previously reported to occur in colon tumors. The transfection of human gastric MKN-1 cells with miR-145 resulted in a greater growth inhibitory effect than that with miR-143, results which were contrary to those in colon cancers. In MKN-1 cells, an additive effect on growth inhibition was shown by the combined transfection with miR-143 and miR-145; further, higher sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil was also observed following the transfection with miR-143 or miR-145. The possible candidate target messenger RNAs of miR-145 were identified to be insulin receptor substrate-1 and beta-actin. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-143 and miR-145 act as anti-oncomirs common to gastrointestinal tumors.

19937137	Title	miR-372 regulates cell cycle and apoptosis of ags human gastric cancer cell line through direct regulation of LATS2.
19937137	Abstract	Previously, we have reported tissue- and stage-specific expression of miR-372 in human embryonic stem cells and so far, not many reports speculate the function of this microRNA (miRNA). In this study, we screened various human cancer cell lines including gastric cancer cell lines and found first time that miR-372 is expressed only in AGS human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line. Inhibition of miR-372 using antisense miR-372 oligonucleotide (AS-miR-372) suppressed proliferation, arrested the cell cycle at G2/M phase, and increased apoptosis of AGS cells. Furthermore, AS-miR-372 treatment increased expression of LATS2, while over-expression of miR-372 decreased luciferase reporter activity driven by the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of LATS2 mRNA. Over-expression of LATS2 induced changes in AGS cells similar to those in AGS cells treated with AS-miR-372. Taken together, these findings demonstrate an oncogenic role for miR-372 in controlling cell growth, cell cycle, and apoptosis through down-regulation of a tumor suppressor gene, LATS2.

20300657	Title	MiR-218 inhibits invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer by targeting the Robo1 receptor.
20300657	Abstract	MicroRNAs play key roles in tumor metastasis. Here, we describe the regulation and function of miR-218 in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. miR-218 expression is decreased along with the expression of one of its host genes, Slit3 in metastatic GC. However, Robo1, one of several Slit receptors, is negatively regulated by miR-218, thus establishing a negative feedback loop. Decreased miR-218 levels eliminate Robo1 repression, which activates the Slit-Robo1 pathway through the interaction between Robo1 and Slit2, thus triggering tumor metastasis. The restoration of miR-218 suppresses Robo1 expression and inhibits tumor cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results describe a Slit-miR-218-Robo1 regulatory circuit whose disruption may contribute to GC metastasis. Targeting miR-218 may provide a strategy for blocking tumor metastasis.

20331975	Title	Epigenetic repression of microRNA-129-2 leads to overexpression of SOX4 in gastric cancer.
20331975	Abstract	High levels of SOX4 expression have been found in a variety of human cancers, such as lung, brain and breast cancers. However, the expression of SOX4 in gastric tissues remains unknown. The SOX4 expression was detected using immunohistochemical staining and semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and our results showed that SOX4 was up-regulated in gastric cancer compared to benign gastric tissues. To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying up-regulation of SOX4 in gastric cancers, we analyzed the expression of microRNA-129-2 (miR-129-2) gene, the epigenetic repression of which leads to overexpression of SOX4 in endometrial cancer. We found that up-regulation of SOX4 was inversely associated with the epigenetic silencing of miR-129-2 in gastric cancer, and restoration of miR-129-2 down-regulated SOX4 expression. We also found that inactivation of SOX4 by siRNA and restoration of miR-129-2 induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells.

20372781	Title	Clinicopathological and prognostic significance of PDCD4 and microRNA-21 in human gastric cancer.
20372781	Abstract	Recent studies have demonstrated that the novel tumor suppressor protein programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) is downregulated in several human solid cancer types and is suppressed by microRNA-21 (miR-21). The objectives of this study were: i) to establish the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of PDCD4 mRNA, and ii) to elucidate any correlation between PDCD4 mRNA and miR-21 in gastric cancer. The expression status of PDCD4 mRNA was investigated by qRT-PCR and protein expression was analyzed by an immunohistochemical study. We analyzed PDCD4 mRNA expression with respect to various clinicopathological factors in 105 gastric cancers. We also performed an association study comparing PDCD4 mRNA and miR-21 in eight cell lines and 49 gastric cancers. Expression of PDCD4 mRNA in cancer tissues was significantly lower than in non-cancer tissues (P<0.05). Patients with low PDCD4 mRNA expression was significantly correlated with size, depth, lymph node metastasis, venous invasion, advanced stage, and poor clinical prognosis (P<0.05). Expression of miR-21 in cancer tissues was significantly higher than in non-cancer tissues (P<0.05). Elevated miR-21 expression was significantly correlated with size and depth (P<0.05). An inverse correlation between PDCD4 mRNA and miR-21 was found in gastric cancer. This study revealed that low PDCD4 expression correlates with biological aggressiveness and poor prognosis in gastric cancer. Furthermore, our findings suggest that PDCD4 mRNA is negatively regulated by miR-21 in gastric cancer and may serve as a target for effective therapies.

20422307	Title	Altered expression of MiR-148a and MiR-152 in gastrointestinal cancers and its clinical significance.
20422307	Abstract	MicroRNAs are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that aberrantly expressed in various carcinomas. MiR-148a and miR-152, which have the same "seed region", have not been comprehensively investigated in gastrointestinal cancers. Total RNA was extracted from the tissues of 101 patients with gastric cancer and 101 patients with colorectal cancer as well as their matched nontumor adjacent tissues. After polyadenylation and reverse transcription, the expression of miR-148a and miR-152 was determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The protein level of cholecystokinin B receptor, which might be the target gene of miR-148a and miR-152, was analyzed by Western blot in 40 patients with gastric cancer. Expression levels of miR-148a and miR-152 in human gastric (p < 0.001 and p = 0.038, respectively, t-test) and colorectal (all p < 0.001) cancers were significantly lower than that in their matched nontumor adjacent tissues. Moreover, their low expression was also found in several gastrointestinal cancer cell lines compared with normal gastric epithelial cell line and normal colorectal tissue, respectively. A strong correlation was found between the expression of miR-148a and miR-152 (all p < 0.001, Pearson's correlation). Furthermore, low expression of miR-152 was correlated with increased tumor size (p = 0.023 and 0.004, respectively, Mann-Whitney U test) and advanced pT stage (p = 0.018 and 0.002, respectively) in gastrointestinal cancers. Low expression of miR-148a was also correlated with increased tumor size (p = 0.045 and 0.018, respectively) in gastrointestinal cancers, but only correlated with advanced pT stage (p = 0.023) in colorectal cancer. We also found the expression of miR-148a (p < 0.001, chi-square test) and miR-152 (p = 0.002) inversely correlated with cholecystokinin B receptor protein in gastric cancer. MiR-148a and miR-152 may be involved in the carcinogenesis of gastrointestinal cancers and might be potential biomarkers in these cancers.

20507733	Title	Effects of microRNA-29 family members on proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cell lines.
20507733	Abstract	MicroRNAs have emerged as post-transcriptional regulators that are critically involved in the biologic behavior of cells. This study was designed to investigate the effect of members of the microRNA-29 family on the expression of cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42) and their roles on proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells. We detected microRNA-29s and Cdc42 expression in gastric cancer cells by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analysis. Negative controlled RNA (ncontrol), microRNA-29 family members (microRNA-29a, -29b, and -29c), and Cdc42-specific small interfering RNA (si-Cdc42) were chemically synthesized and transfected into SGC7901 and BGC823 gastric cancer cells, which have a relatively low expression of microRNA-29s and a relatively high expression of Cdc42. The expression of Cdc42 and the phosphorylation of its downstream molecular PAK1 expressions were determined by Western bolt analysis. Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to measure cell proliferation, and wound-healing and invasion assays were used to examine the abilities of migration and invasion. Similar to si-Cdc42, the ectopic expression of microRNA-29 family members significantly reduced the expression of Cdc42 and its downstream molecular PAK1 phosphorylation levels. Consistently, ectopic expression of microRNA-29s inhibited proliferation and migration in gastric cancer cells. Invasive cell counts of the SGC7901, ncontrol/SGC7901, si-Cdc42/SGC7901, microRNA-29a/SGC7901, microRNA-29b/SGC7901, and microRNA-29c/SGC7901 cell groups were 84.0+/-4.2, 71.7+/-4.6, 16.3+/-3.2, 15.7+/-3.8, 16.3+/-3.0, and 16.7+/-3.1, respectively. The invasive cell counts of the BGC823, ncontrol/BGC823, si-Cdc42/BGC823, microRNA-29a/BGC823, microRNA-29b/BGC823, and microRNA-29c/BGC823 cell groups were 199.0+/-10.5, 146.3+/-9.7, 72.7+/-8.2, 86.7+/-8.5, 86.0+/-8.5, and 73.3+/-8.3, respectively (P<0.05). Members of the microRNA-29 family can obviously inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and invasion of gastric cancer cells by targeting Cdc42.

20666778	Title	Hsa-mir-27a genetic variant contributes to gastric cancer susceptibility through affecting miR-27a and target gene expression.
20666778	Abstract	Aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression is presently proposed to correlate with various human cancers and common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at miRNA genes can influence the maturation of miRNAs or miRNA-mediated transcriptional regulation. However, whether miRNAs SNP alter gastric cancer susceptibility is still unclear. Here we investigated the possible role of a common A/G polymorphism (rs895819) within hsa-mir-27a in the development or progression of gastric cancer, and assessed the effect of rs895819 on the expression of miR-27a and its target gene Zinc finger and BTB domain containing 10 (ZBTB10). In the present case-control study, we found that subjects with the variant genotypes (AG + GG) showed a significantly increased risk of gastric cancer relative to AA carriers (adjusted odds ratio = 1.48, 95% confidence interval 1.06-2.05; P = 0.019). The elevated risk was especially evident in older subjects (age >58 years), men, nonsmokers and rural subjects. A significant association of hsa-mir-27a variant genotypes with lymph node metastasis was also observed. Further functional analyses indicated that variant genotypes might be responsible for elevated miR-27a levels and reduced ZBTB10 mRNA. Moreover, an inverse correlation was found between ZBTB10 and miR-27a levels. In conclusion, we were the first to show that a common polymorphism (rs895819) in hsa-mir-27a, by modulating miR-27a and ZBTB10 levels, acted as an important factor of the gastric cancer susceptibility.

21029372	Title	MicroRNA-107, an oncogene microRNA that regulates tumour invasion and metastasis by targeting DICER1 in gastric cancer.
21029372	Abstract	MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules that control expression of target genes. Previous studies showed that microRNA-107 (miR-107) is overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues compared with the matched normal tissues. However, it remains largely unclear as to how miR-107 exerts its function and modulates the malignant phenotypes of gastric cancer, because our understanding of miR-107 signalling pathways is limited. In this study, we demonstrate that miR-107 is frequently up-regulated in gastric cancers and its overexpression is significantly associated with gastric cancer metastasis. Furthermore, silencing the expression of miR-107 could inhibit gastric cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Subsequent investigation characterized DICER1 as a direct target of miR-107. Up-regulation of DICER1 resulted in a dramatic reduction of in vitro migration, invasion, in vivo liver metastasis of nude mice, which is similar to that occurs with the silencing of miR-107, indicating that DICER1 functions as a metastasis suppressor in gastric cancer. Furthermore, the restoration of DICER1 can inhibit miR-107-induced gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis. In conclusion, our results suggested that miR-107, an oncogene miRNA promoting gastric cancer metastasis through down-regulation of DICER1. Inhibition of miR-107 or restoration of DICER1 may represent a new potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer treatment.

21053104	Title	Down-regulation of miR-212 expression by DNA hypermethylation in human gastric cancer cells.
21053104	Abstract	There has been few report discussing the expression and function of miR-212 in gastric cancer (GC). The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the expression of miR-212 in both gastric cancer tissues and gastric cancer cells and further explores the possible reasons for this change and the impact on the development of gastric cancer. qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-212 in primary GC tissues, adjacent normal tissues, gastric cancer cell lines BGC-823, SGC-7901, MKN-45, and normal gastric mucosa cell line GES. The expression of miR-212 was evaluated before and after treatment with methylation inhibitor-5-Aza-2'-deoxycitidine (5-Aza-dC), finally anti-miRNA and dual luciferase reporter assay were used to prove that MYC is a target gene of miR-212. The results showed that a significant reduction of miR-212 expression in GC tissues was observed compared to that in normal tissues (P = 0.002). At the same time, miR-212 expression level in normal gastric mucosa cell line GES was higher than that of in gastric cancer cell lines BGC-823, SGC-7901, and MKN-45 (P = 0.015, 0.008, 0.044, respectively). Computer sequence analysis showed the hypermethylation of CpG islands(CPI) in the promoter regions of miR-212 led to the lower expression of miR-212 in gastric cell strains (BGC-823 and SGC-7901). MiR-212 expression was significantly recovered after treatment with methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-dC (P = 0.016, 0.000, 0.015, respectively). Then, the results of AMOs transfection and dual luciferase reporter assay showed that Myc is a target of miR-212, which will be helpful to verify the function of miR-212 in carcinogenesis. The conclusion could be deduced from the study that decreased expression of miR-212 may be due to hypermethylation of CPI in gastric cancer cells, and miR-212 might act on the progression of gastric cancer through the potential target gene Myc.

21119604	Title	MicroRNA-192 and -215 are upregulated in human gastric cancer in vivo and suppress ALCAM expression in vitro.
21119604	Abstract	The dismal outcome of gastric cancer patients highlights the need for diagnostic biomarkers and effective therapeutic targets, such as microRNAs. We sought to discover microRNAs involved in gastric cancer, and to elucidate their downstream target mechanisms. Both cultured gastric epithelial cells (HFE145 and NCI-N87) and primary human gastric tissues (31 non-neoplastic stomach (NS) and 25 gastric carcinomas (GC)) were studied. MicroRNA microarrays and quantitative RT-PCR were applied to discover and verify differentially expressed microRNAs. in vitro cell migration and invasion, cell proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis assays were executed to elucidate biological effects of microRNA-192 and -215. Western blotting and luciferase assays were performed to confirm direct messenger RNA targeting by microRNA-192 and -215. MicroRNA microarray analyses revealed that 25 and 20 microRNAs were upregulated and downregulated in GC vs NS, respectively. Expression levels of both microRNA-192 and -215 were significantly higher in GC than in NS (P<0.05). Luciferase assays suggested that microRNA-215 inhibits activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) expression at the posttranscriptional level. In addition, expression levels of ALCAM were significantly lower in GC than in NS. Mimics and inhibitors, respectively, of microRNA-192 or -215 exerted no effect on cell cycle or apoptosis in the immortalized normal gastric cell line HFE145 or the gastric cancer cell line NCI-N87. However, mimics of microRNA-192 or -215 significantly increased growth rates in HFE145 cells, whereas inhibitors of microRNA-192 or -215 caused significant decreases in growth rates in NCI-N87 cells. ALCAM knockdown by an ALCAM-specific siRNA significantly increased cell growth in HFE145 cells. Both transfection of mimics of microRNA-192 or -215 and ALCAM knockdown by an ALCAM-specific siRNA significantly increased the migration of HFE145 cells. In conclusion, in gastric cancer, both microRNA-192 and -215 are overexpressed in vivo and exert cell growth and migration-promoting effects in vitro, thus representing potential microRNAs with a role in cancer in the human stomach.

21156161	Title	Down-regulation of VEZT gene expression in human gastric cancer involves promoter methylation and miR-43c.
21156161	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and promoter methylation are two vital important mechanisms for transcriptional inactivation of a gene in human cancer; VEZT gene is a plasma membrane component of adherens junctions, the role of VEZT still remains largely unexplored in gastric cancer. In the study, we analyzed the expression of VEZT gene in 30 pair matched gastric neoplastic and adjacent non-neoplastic tissues by quantitative real-time PCR, and we show that VEZT mRNA expression was significantly reduced in 30 pairs of gastric cancer specimens compared to matched normal gastric tissues. Methylation specific-PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequence-PCR (BSP) methods showed hypermethylation status of promoter site of all gastric cancer cell lines. After DNA methylation inhibitor 5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) treatment on gastric cancer cell lines, the gene protein level was improved and suppresses cell cycle progression remarkably. Furthermore, a luciferase reporter assay demonstrates that miR-43c directly targets adherens junctions' transmembrane protein (VEZT) and suppresses VEZT protein expression. These findings help clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in gastric cancer and indicate that VEZT gene may be a bona fide methylation-based treatment of gastric cancer.

21258880	Title	miR-497 modulates multidrug resistance of human cancer cell lines by targeting BCL2.
21258880	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNA molecules, which posttranscriptionally regulate genes expression and play crucial roles in diverse biological processes, such as development, differentiation, apoptosis, and proliferation. Here, we investigated the possible role of miRNAs in the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) in human gastric and lung cancer cell lines. We found that miR-497 was downregulated in both multidrug-resistant human gastric cancer cell line SGC7901/vincristine (VCR) and multidrug-resistant human lung cancer cell line A549/cisplatin (CDDP) and the downregulation of miR-497 was concurrent with the upregulation of BCL2 protein, compared with the parental SGC7901 and A549 cell lines, respectively. In vitro drug sensitivity assay demonstrated that overexpression of miR-497 sensitized SGC7901/VCR and A549/CDDP cells to anticancer drugs, respectively. The luciferase activity of BCL2 3'-untranslated region-based reporter constructed in SGC7901/VCR and A549/CDDP cells suggested that BCL2 was the direct target gene of miR-497. Enforced miR-497 expression reduced BCL2 protein level and sensitized SGC7901/VCR and A549/CDDP cells to VCR-induced and CDDP-induced apoptosis, respectively. Taken together, our findings first suggested that has-miR-497 could play a role in both gastric and lung cancer cell lines at least in part by modulation of apoptosis via targeting BCL2.

21349817	Title	Low-level expression of let-7a in gastric cancer and its involvement in tumorigenesis by targeting RAB40C.
21349817	Abstract	Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide but the underlying molecular mechanism is not entirely clear. The objective of this study was to explore the role of let-7a microRNA (miRNA) in gastric tumorigenesis and the possible correlation between RAB40C and let-7a miRNA in gastric cancer. We found that expression of let-7a is reduced in human gastric cancer tissues and cell lines and there was a significant correlation between the level of let-7a expression and the stage of differentiation. Overexpression of let-7a resulted in a decrease in cell proliferation and G(1) arrest, significantly suppressed anchorage-dependent growth in vitro and the tumorigenicity of gastric cancer cells in a nude mouse xenograft model. Furthermore, we demonstrated that RAB40C is regulated directly by let-7a and plays an essential role as a mediator of the biological effects of let-7a in gastric tumorigenesis. This study revealed that let-7a is significant in suppressing gastric cancer growth in vivo and in vitro and provided the first evidence that RAB40C is negatively regulated by let-7a at the posttranscriptional level via binding to the 3'-untranslated region of RAB40C messenger RNA in gastric cancer. The results of this study suggest that let-7a and RAB40C are potentially useful targets for gastric cancer diagnosis and therapy.

21415212	Title	Genomic loss of miR-486 regulates tumor progression and the OLFM4 antiapoptotic factor in gastric cancer.
21415212	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNA) play pivotal oncogenic and tumor-suppressor roles in several human cancers. We sought to discover novel tumor-suppressor miRNAs in gastric cancer (GC). Using Agilent miRNA microarrays, we compared miRNA expression profiles of 40 primary gastric tumors and 40 gastric normal tissues, identifying miRNAs significantly downregulated in gastric tumors. Among the top 80 miRNAs differentially expressed between gastric tumors and normals (false discovery rate < 0.01), we identified hsa-miR-486 (miR-486) as a significantly downregulated miRNA in primary GCs and GC cell lines. Restoration of miR-486 expression in GC cell lines (YCC3, SCH and AGS) caused suppression of several pro-oncogenic traits, whereas conversely inhibiting miR-486 expression in YCC6 GC cells enhanced cellular proliferation. Array-CGH analysis of 106 primary GCs revealed genomic loss of the miR-486 locus in approximately 25% to 30% of GCs, including two tumors with focal genomic losses specifically deleting miR-486, consistent with miR-486 playing a tumor-suppressive role. Bioinformatic analysis identified the secreted antiapoptotic glycoprotein OLFM4 as a potential miR-486 target. Restoring miR-486 expression in GC cells decreased endogenous OLFM4 transcript and protein levels, and also inhibited expression of luciferase reporters containing an OLFM4 3' untranslated region with predicted miR-486 binding sites. Supporting the biological relevance of OLFM4 as a miR-486 target, proliferation in GC cells was also significantly reduced by OLFM4 silencing. miR-486 may function as a novel tumor-suppressor miRNA in GC. Its antioncogenic activity may involve the direct targeting and inhibition of OLFM4.

21533124	Title	MicroRNA let-7f inhibits tumor invasion and metastasis by targeting MYH9 in human gastric cancer.
21533124	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators that play key roles in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. A previous report has shown that let-7 family members can act as tumor suppressors in many cancers. Through miRNA array, we found that let-7f was downregulated in the highly metastatic potential gastric cancer cell lines GC9811-P and SGC7901-M, when compared with their parental cell lines, GC9811 and SGC7901-NM; however, the mechanism was not clear. In this study, we investigate whether let-7f acts as a tumor suppressor to inhibit invasion and metastasis in gastric cancers. Real-time PCR showed decreased levels of let-7f expression in metastatic gastric cancer tissues and cell lines that are potentially highly metastatic. Cell invasion and migration were significantly impaired in GC9811-P and SGC7901-M cell lines after transfection with let-7f-mimics. Nude mice with xenograft models of gastric cancer confirmed that let-7f could inhibit gastric cancer metastasis in vivo after transfection by the lentivirus pGCsil-GFP- let-7f. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that let-7f directly binds to the 3'UTR of MYH9, which codes for myosin IIA, and real-time PCR and Western blotting further indicated that let-7f downregulated the expression of myosin IIA at the mRNA and protein levels. Our study demonstrated that overexpression of let-7f in gastric cancer could inhibit invasion and migration of gastric cancer cells through directly targeting the tumor metastasis-associated gene MYH9. These data suggest that let-7f may be a novel therapeutic candidate for gastric cancer, given its ability to reduce cell invasion and metastasis.

21569481	Title	Down-regulation of miR-27a might inhibit proliferation and drug resistance of gastric cancer cells.
21569481	Abstract	Here we aimed to firstly investigate the role of miR-27a in proliferation and multidrug resistance of gastric cancer cells. The role of miR-27a in gastric cancer cells was detected using MTT assay, soft agar assay, flow cytometry assay, nude mice assay, real-time PCR, western blot and reporter gene assay, etc. Down-regulation of miR-27a could inhibit porliferation of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Down-regulation of miR-27a could also confer sensitivity of drugs on gastric cancer cells, and might increase accumulation and decrease releasing amount of adriamycin in gastric cancer cells. Down-regulation of miR-27a could significantly decrease the expression of P-glycoprotein and the transcriptional activity of cyclin D1, and up-regulate the expression of p21. MiR-27a might play important roles in porliferation and drug resistance of gastric cancer. MiR-27a might be considered as a useful target for cancer therapy.

21688200	Title	Down-regulated miRNA-214 induces a cell cycle G1 arrest in gastric cancer cells by up-regulating the PTEN protein.
21688200	Abstract	To detect the expression of miRNA-214 in human gastric cancer cell lines of BGC823, MKN45 and SGC7901, and to identify the effect of miRNA-214 on cell cycle and apoptosis of these cells. Expression of miRNA-214 in human normal gastric mucosal cell line GES-1 and human gastric cancer cell lines was detected by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Antisense-miRNA-214 oligonucleotides were transfected transiently into gastric cancer cell lines to down-regulate the expression of miRNA-214. The cell cycle and apoptosis were studied by flow cytometry assay. PTEN, one of the target genes of miRNA-214 was detected by using of immunocytochemistry and Western blotting. MiRNA-214 was overexpressed in gastric cancer cell lines of BGC823, MKN45 and SGC7901 compared with normal gastric mucosal cell line GES-1. Antisense-miRNA-214 oligonucleotides significantly down-regulated the expression of miRNA-214, and increased the portion of G1-phase and decreased the portion of S-phase in BGC823 and MKN45 cells. The immunocytochemistry test and Western blotting analysis showed that the down-regulation of miRNA-214 could significantly up-regulate the expression of PTEN in BGC823 and MKN45 cells. MiRNA-214 is overexpressed in human gastric cancer cell lines of BGC823, MKN45 and SGC7901. The down-regulation of miRNA-214 could induce a G1 cell cycle arrest in them, the up-regulation of PTEN maybe one of the mechanism.

21703006	Title	Integrative network analysis reveals active microRNAs and their functions in gastric cancer.
21703006	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous, small and highly conserved noncoding RNAs that control gene expression either by degradation of target mRNAs or by inhibition of protein translation. They play important roles in cancer progression. A single miRNA can provoke a chain reaction and further affect protein interaction network (PIN). Therefore, we developed a novel integrative approach to identify the functional roles and the regulated PIN of oncomirs. We integrated the expression profiles of miRNA and mRNA with the human PIN to reveal miRNA-regulated PIN in specific biological conditions. The potential functions of miRNAs were determined by functional enrichment analysis and the activities of miRNA-regulated PINs were evaluated by the co-expression of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). The function of a specific miRNA, miR-148a, was further examined by clinical data analysis and cell-based experiments. We uncovered several miRNA-regulated networks which were enriched with functions related to cancer progression. One miRNA, miR-148a, was identified and its function is to decrease tumor proliferation and metastasis through its regulated PIN. Furthermore, we found that miR-148a could reduce the invasiveness, migratory and adhesive activities of gastric tumor cells. Most importantly, elevated miR-148a level in gastric cancer tissues was strongly correlated with distant metastasis, organ and peritoneal invasion and reduced survival rate. This study provides a novel method to identify active oncomirs and their potential functions in gastric cancer progression. The present data suggest that miR-148a could be a potential prognostic biomarker of gastric cancer and function as a tumor suppressor through repressing the activity of its regulated PIN.

21711453	Title	Constitutive activation of the ETS-1-miR-222 circuitry in metastatic melanoma.
21711453	Abstract	MicroRNAs-221 and -222 are highly upregulated in several solid tumors, including melanomas. We demonstrate that the proto-oncogene ETS-1, involved in the pathogenesis of cancers of different origin, is a transcriptional regulator of miR-222 by direct binding to its promoter region. Differently from 293FT cells or early stage melanomas, where unphosphorylated ETS-1 represses miR-222 transcription, in metastatic melanoma the constitutively Thr-38 phosphorylated fraction of ETS-1 induces miR-222. Despite its stepwise decreased expression along with melanoma progression, the oncogenic activity of ETS-1 relies on its RAS/RAF/ERK-dependent phosphorylation status more than on its total amount. To close the loop, we demonstrate ETS-1 as a direct target of miR-222, but not miR-221, showing the novel option of their uncoupled functions. In addition, a spatial redistribution of ETS-1 protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm is also evidenced in advanced melanoma cells. Finally, in vivo studies confirmed the contribution of miR-222 to the increased invasive potential obtained by ETS- silencing.

21788734	Title	Two common SNPs in pri-miR-125a alter the mature miRNA expression and associate with recurrent pregnancy loss in a Han-Chinese population.
21788734	Abstract	Although there are plenty of evidence that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that fall within coding sequences of genes are involved in recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), it is still unknown whether the polymorphisms in microRNAs (miRNAs) are related with RPL. In this study, we established this kind of association by confirming significant differences in genotype distribution of rs41275794 (P= 0.0005) and rs12976445 (P= 0.001) within the pri-miR-125a in 217 Han Chinese patients of RPL compared with 431 controls. Based on this observation, two-locus haplotypes were constructed and the A-T haplotype was found to be associated with an increased risk of RPL (OR=2.84, 95%C.I. 1.98-4.07, P=0.0000000057). Further analysis showed that the levels of pre- and mature- miR-125a were down-regulated in the cells transfected with the A-T haplotype, which was consistent with in vivo detection that the level of mature miR-125a was lower in 30 pregnant women with A-T haplotype than that with G-C haplotype. During in vitro RNA processing assays, we found a similar decrease in the amount of pre-miR-125a and decline in binding capacity of nuclear factors to pri-miR-125a with A-T haplotype. More importantly, the reduction in miR-125a, as a consequence of A-T haplotype, further led to less efficient inhibition of target genes, LIFR and ERBB2, which play important roles in the embryo implantation and decidualization. Thus, our data collectively suggest that two common polymorphisms in pre-miR-125a might contribute to the genetic predisposition to RPL by disrupting the production of miR-125a, which consequently interfered in the expression and function of target genes of miR-125a.

21845495	Title	Inverse association between miR-194 expression and tumor invasion in gastric cancer.
21845495	Abstract	MiR-194 has been shown to be specifically expressed in the human gastrointestinal tract and may play an antimetastatic role in primary liver cancer cells. However, the role of miR-194 in gastric cancer is still unclear. Total RNA was extracted from tissues of 119 patients with gastric cancer and three gastric cancer cell lines (SGC-7901, MGC-803, and BGC-823). Expression levels of miR-194 were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Moreover, a MTT proliferation assay and transwell cell invasion assay were performed to study the effect of miR-194 on SGC-7901 cell proliferation and invasion. Finally, we used real-time PCR and western blot to verify which gene was the target of miR-194 in gastric cancer. Though there was no significant difference between cancerous and matching noncancerous tissues, we found patients with lower expression of miR-194 tended to have larger tumor size (P = 0.002) and more advanced pT stage (P = 0.028) in gastric cancer. Moreover, the expression of miR-194 was significantly lower in Borrmann IV type gastric cancer than in Borrmann I, II, and III types (P = 0.019). Furthermore, an in vitro invasion assay indicated that the penetrated cell intensity after miR-194 mimics transfection was significantly lower than the control. However, overexpression of miR-194 had little effect on the SGC-7901 cell cycle and proliferation. The results of real-time PCR and western blot highlighted that miR-194 interacted with N-cadherin and negatively regulated its expression at the translational level. These findings imply that miR-194 might play an important role in gastric cancer invasion and progression.

21925125	Title	HER2 interacts with CD44 to up-regulate CXCR4 via epigenetic silencing of microRNA-139 in gastric cancer cells.
21925125	Abstract	Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) (neu/ERBB2) is overexpressed on many types of cancer cells, including gastric cancer cells; HER2 overexpression has been associated with metastasis and poor prognosis. We investigated the mechanisms by which HER2 regulates cell migration and invasion. HER2 expression or activity was reduced in gastric cancer cell lines using small interfering RNAs or the monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab. We identified proteins that interact with HER2 or microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in HER2 signaling. We used various software programs to identify miRNAs that regulate factors in the HER2 signaling pathway. We analyzed expression patterns of these miRNAs in gastric cancer cell lines and tumor samples from patients. We found that CD44 binds directly to HER2, which up-regulates the expression of metastasis-associated protein-1, induces deacetylation of histone H3 lysine 9, and suppresses transcription of microRNA139 (miR-139) to inhibit expression of its target gene, C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4). Knockdown of HER2 and CD44 reduced invasive activity of cultured gastric cancer cells and suppressed tumor growth in nude mice. Lymph node metastasis was associated with high levels of HER2, CD44, and CXCR4, and reduced levels of miR-139 in human metastatic gastric tumors. Cultures of different types of metastatic cancer cells with histone deacetylase inhibitors and/or DNA methyltransferase resulted in up-regulation of miR-139. HER2 interaction with CD44 up-regulates CXCR4 by inhibiting expression of miR-139, at the epigenetic level, in gastric cancer cells. These findings indicate how HER2 signaling might promote gastric tumor progression and metastasis.

21931274	Title	Aberrant hypermethylation of miR-9 genes in gastric cancer.
21931274	Abstract	Carcinogenesis of the stomach involves multiple steps including genetic mutation or epigenetic alteration of tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes. Recently, tumor suppressive miRNAs have been shown to be deregulated by aberrant hypermethylation during gastric cancer progression. In this study, we demonstrate that three independent genetic loci encoding for miR-9 (miR-9-1, miR-9-2 and miR-9-3) are simultaneously modified by DNA methylation in gastric cancer cells. Methylation-mediated silencing of these three miR-9 genes can be reactivated in gastric cancer cells through 5-Aza-dC treatment. Subsequent analysis of the expression levels of miR-9 showed that it was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancers compared with adjacent normal tissues (P value < 0.005). A similar tendency toward a tumor-specific DNA methylation pattern was shown for miR-9-1, miR-9-2 and miR-9-3 in 72 primary human gastric cancer specimens. Ectopic expression of miR-9 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting its tumor suppressive potential in gastric cancer progression.

21932133	Title	Carcinogenesis of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm of the pancreas: loss of microRNA-101 promotes overexpression of histone methyltransferase EZH2.
21932133	Abstract	The mechanisms of IPMN carcinogenesis are as yet unclear. This study aimed to determine whether expression of EZH2 promotes neoplastic progression of IPMN and PDCA, and to elucidate regulation of EZH2 expression by miR-101. EZH2 mRNA and protein expression were investigated in 8 human pancreatic cancer cell lines by PCR and western blotting. Pre-miR-101 and anti-miR-101 were transfected into pancreatic cancer cells to elucidate EZH2 regulation by miR-101. To evaluate whether EZH2 modulates malignant progression of IPMN, EZH2 expression in IPMN was examined by immunohistochemistry. Next, we collected malignant and benign cells from FFPE samples of IPMNs using laser capture microdissection and extracted the RNA. miR-101 expression in IPMN was assessed using real-time PCR. All pancreatic cancer cell lines expressed EZH2 mRNA and protein. The induction of miR-101 by transfection of pre-miR-101 in MIA PaCa-2 was closely related to a reduction in EZH2 protein production compared with control, whereas there was little difference in the expression of EZH2 mRNA. Anti-miR-101 transfected pancreatic cancer cells showed an increase in EZH2 protein, while the level of EZH2 mRNA was not elevated. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the expression of EZH2 was significantly higher in malignant than benign IPMN. Expression of miR-101 was significantly lower in malignant IPMN than benign IPMN. MiR-101 targets EZH2 at the posttranscriptional level, and loss of miR-101 could be a trigger for the adenomacarcinoma sequence of IPMN by upregulation of EZH2. This study suggests miR-101-EZH2 blockade as a potential therapeutic target in IPMN carcinogenesis.

21993632	Title	MiR-101 and Mcl-1 in non-small-cell lung cancer: expression profile and clinical significance.
21993632	Abstract	Recently, accumulating evidence indicates that dysregulation of miRNAs is associated with the initiation and progression of cancer. MiR-101 has been reported down-regulated in various types of cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression profile of miR-101 and its target gene Mcl-1 in NSCLC and to assess their clinical significance. QRT-PCR was used in the detection of miR-101 and Mcl-1 mRNA expression both in NSCLC tissue and in adjacent normal lung tissue. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis were used in the detection of Mcl-1 protein expression. The clinicopathological implications of these molecules were analyzed statistically. Survival analysis was performed to assess prognostic significance. Down-regulation of miR-101 was associated with overexpression of Mcl-1 mRNA in NSCLC tissue when compared with corresponding normal tissue, with a negative correlation (r = -0.724, P < 0.01). MiR-101 expression was significantly associated with pathological stage (P = 0.004) and lymph node involvement (P = 0.012). Overexpression of Mcl-1 was associated with pathological grade (P = 0.022) and lymph node involvement (P = 0.017). A comparison of survival curves of low versus high expressers of miR-101 and Mcl-1 revealed a highly significant difference in NSCLC (P < 0.05), which suggests that reduced expression of miR-101 versus overexpression of Mcl-1 is associated with a poorer prognosis. Our results suggest that down-regulation of miR-101 may result in enhanced expression of Mcl-1 in NSCLC, which consequently favored tumor progression. MiR-101 and Mcl-1 may play important roles as biomarkers for prognosis and therapeutic targets in NSCLC.

21994419	Title	MicroRNA-148a suppresses tumor cell invasion and metastasis by downregulating ROCK1 in gastric cancer.
21994419	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNA) have been documented playing a critical role in cancer development and progression. In this study, we investigate the role of miR-148a in gastric cancer metastasis. We examined miR-148a levels in 90 gastric cancer samples by qRT-PCR and analyzed the clinicopathologic significance of miR-148a expression. The gastric cancer cells stably expressing miRNA-148a were analyzed for migration and invasion assays in vitro and metastasis assays in vivo; the target genes of miR-148a were further explored. We found that miR-148a expression was suppressed by more than 4-fold in gastric cancer compared with their corresponding nontumorous tissues, and the downregulated miR-148a was significantly associated with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and lymph node-metastasis. Functional assays showed that overexpression of miR-148a suppressed gastric cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and lung metastasis formation in vivo. In addition, overexpression of miR-148a in GC cells could reduce the mRNA and protein levels of ROCK1, whereas miR-148a silencing significantly increased ROCK1 expression. Luciferase assays confirmed that miR-148a could directly bind to the 2 sites of 3' untranslated region of ROCK1. Moreover, in gastric cancer tissues, we observed an inverse correlation between miR-148a and ROCK1 expression. Knockdown of ROCK1 significantly inhibited gastric cancer cell migration and invasion resembling that of miR-148a overexpression. We further found that ROCK1 was involved in miR-148a-induced suppression of gastric cancer cell migration and invasion. miR-148a functions as a tumor metastasis suppressor in gastric cancer, and downregulation of miR-148a contributes to gastric cancer lymph node-metastasis and progression. miR-148a may have a therapeutic potential to suppress gastric cancer metastasis.

22020746	Title	Increased miR-146a in gastric cancer directly targets SMAD4 and is involved in modulating cell proliferation and apoptosis.
22020746	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important gene regulators and are recognized as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes in carcinogenesis. Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases worldwide. Our previous studies have revealed that miR-146a is upregulated in gastric epithelial cells infected with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and in mucosal tissues from H. pylori-positive patients. However, the role of miR-146a in gastric cancer is largely unknown. In the current study, we showed that miR-146a was upregulated in 20 gastric cancer tissues compared with matched non-tumor adjacent tissues by quantitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, ectopic expression of miR-146a could improve cell proliferation in vitro by using Cell Counting kit 8 (CCK-8). We also found that miR-146a inhibited apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by flow cytometry (FCM) and Caspase-Glo® 3/7 assay. Using target prediction algorithms, luciferase reporter assay and Western blot assay, SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4) was identified as a target gene of miR-146a in gastric cancer. Moreover, an inverse correlation was observed between the expression of SMAD4 mRNA and miR-146a in gastric cancer tissues (R=-0.731, P=0.039, Pearson's correlation). Taken together, our results provide important evidence that miR-146a can directly target SMAD4, and suggest that miR-146a may play a role in the development of gastric cancer by modulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. miR-146a could serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target against gastric cancer.

22190470	Title	A frequent somatic mutation in CD274 3'-UTR leads to protein over-expression in gastric cancer by disrupting miR-570 binding.
22190470	Abstract	Inhibitory costimulatory molecule CD274 expresses in various cancers and contributes to cancer immune evasion by inhibiting T cell activation and proliferation, yet the regulatory mechanisms for CD274 overexpression in cancers are poorly understood. In this study, we discovered a novel mechanism of CD274 expression regulated by miR-570. A guanine-to-cytosine mutation at the 3'-UTR of CD274 mRNA led to CD274 overexpression by disrupting the miR-570 binding. The mutations were widely observed in cancers by sequencing of 276 gastrointestinal cancers (esophageal, gastric, colorectal, hepatocellular, and pancreatic cancers). This mutation was significantly associated with CD274 overexpression in gastric cancer (P = 1.44*10(-10)) and with the pathological features including differentiation grade, depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis, and tumor-node-metastases (TNM) stage. These findings suggest a novel regulatory mechanism for CD274 overexpression in gastric cancer mediated by miR-570 and a somatic mutation in CD274 3'-UTR, and provide a new insight to gastric carcinogenesis.

22212233	Title	PDCD4 expression inversely correlated with miR-21 levels in gastric cancers.
22212233	Abstract	The specific aim of this study was to investigate whether the PDCD4 gene is involved in the development and progression of gastric cancer. We examined the genetic and epigenetic alterations of the PDCD4 gene as well as the expression of PDCD4 protein in gastric cancers. The mRNA expression of PDCD4 and miRNA-21 expression were also analyzed using quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Loss or reduced PDCD4 expression was observed in 79 (36.7%) of 215 gastric cancer specimens. Statistically, altered PDCD4 expression was not associated with the clinicopathological parameters, including tumor differentiation, location, lymph node metastasis and overall survival (P > 0.05). miRNA-21 overexpression was frequently detected in gastric cancers (31 of 46, 67.4%), and there was a significant inverse correlation between miRNA-21 and PDCD4 protein expression (P = 0.029), but not between miRNA-21 and PDCD4 mRNA expression. In genetic analysis, no mutation was detected in the coding region of the PDCD4 gene, and promoter hypermethylation was found in 24 (36.4%) of the 66 gastric cancer samples. Our data suggest that overexpression of miRNA-21 and reduced or loss of PDCD4 expression may play a role in the development and progression of gastric cancers.

22249248	Title	Sequential analysis of multistage hepatocarcinogenesis reveals that miR-100 and PLK1 dysregulation is an early event maintained along tumor progression.
22249248	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have an important role in a wide range of physiological and pathological processes, and their dysregulation has been reported to affect the development and progression of cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, in the plethora of dysregulated miRNAs, it is largely unknown which of them have a causative role in the hepatocarcinogenic process. In the present study, we first aimed to determine changes in the expression profile of miRNAs in human HCCs and to compare them with liver tumors generated in a rat model of chemically induced HCC. We found that members of the miR-100 family (miR-100, miR-99a) were downregulated in human HCCs; a similar downregulation was also observed in rat HCCs. Their reduction was paralleled by an increased expression of polo like kinase 1 (PLK1), a target of these miRNAs. The introduction of miR-100 in HCC cells impaired their growth ability and their capability to form colonies in soft agar. Next, we aimed at investigating, in the same animal model, if dysregulation of miR-100 and PLK1 is an early or late event along the multistep process of hepatocarcinogenesis. The obtained results showed that miR-100 downregulation (i) is already evident in very early preneoplastic lesions generated 9 weeks after carcinogenic treatment; (ii) is also observed in adenomas and early HCCs; and (iii) is not simply a marker of proliferating hepatocytes. To our knowledge, this is the first work unveiling the role of a miRNA family along HCC progression.

22266852	Title	Translational control of TWIST1 expression in MCF-10A cell lines recapitulating breast cancer progression.
22266852	Abstract	TWIST1 is a highly conserved basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Its misregulation has been observed in various types of tumors. Using the MCF-10A-series of cell lines that recapitulate the early stages of breast cancer formation and EMT, we found TWIST1 to be upregulated during EMT and downregulated early in carcinogenesis. The TWIST1 3'UTR contains putative regulatory elements, including miRNA target sites and two cytoplasmic polyadenylation elements (CPE). We found that miR-580, CPEB1, and CPEB2 act as negative regulators of TWIST1 expression in a sequence-specific and additive/cooperative manner.

22267003	Title	The miR-17-92 cluster regulates FOG-2 expression and inhibits proliferation of mouse embryonic cardiomyocytes.
22267003	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have gradually been recognized as regulators of embryonic development; however, relatively few miRNAs have been identified that regulate cardiac development. A series of recent papers have established an essential role for the miRNA-17-92 (miR-17-92) cluster of miRNAs in the development of the heart. Previous research has shown that the Friend of Gata-2 (FOG-2) is critical for cardiac development. To investigate the possibility that the miR-17-92 cluster regulates FOG-2 expression and inhibits proliferation in mouse embryonic cardiomyocytes we initially used bioinformatics to analyze 3' untranslated regions (3'UTR) of FOG-2 to predict the potential of miR-17-92 to target it. We used luciferase assays to demonstrate that miR-17-5p and miR-20a of miR-17-92 interact with the predicted target sites in the 3'UTR of FOG-2. Furthermore, RT-PCR and Western blot were used to demonstrate the post-transcriptional regulation of FOG-2 by miR-17-92 in embryonic cardiomyocytes from E12.5-day pregnant C57BL/6J mice. Finally, EdU cell assays together with the FOG-2 rescue strategy were employed to evaluate the effect of proliferation on embryonic cardiomyocytes. We first found that the miR-17-5p and miR-20a of miR-17-92 directly target the 3'UTR of FOG-2 and post-transcriptionally repress the expression of FOG-2. Moreover, our findings demonstrated that over-expression of miR-17-92 may inhibit cell proliferation via post-transcriptional repression of FOG-2 in embryonic cardiomyocytes. These results indicate that the miR-17-92 cluster regulates the expression of FOG-2 protein and suggest that the miR-17-92 cluster might play an important role in heart development.

22286770	Title	The miR-106b-25 cluster targets Smad7, activates TGF-Beta signaling, and induces EMT and tumor initiating cell characteristics downstream of Six1 in human breast cancer.
22286770	Abstract	The role of TGF-Beta signaling in tumorigenesis is paradoxical: it can be tumor suppressive or tumor promotional, depending on context. The metastatic regulator, Six1, was recently shown to mediate this switch, providing a novel means to explain this elusive 'TGF-Beta paradox'. Herein, we identify a mechanism by which Six1 activates the tumor promotional arm of TGF-Beta signaling, via its ability to upregulate the miR-106b-25 microRNA cluster, and further identify a novel function for this cluster of microRNAs. Although expression of the miR-106b-25 cluster is known to overcome TGF-Beta-mediated growth suppression via targeting p21 and BIM, we demonstrate for the first time that this same cluster can additionally target the inhibitory Smad7 protein, resulting in increased levels of the TGF-Beta type I receptor and downstream activation of TGF-Beta signaling. We further show that the miR-106b-25 cluster is sufficient to induce an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and a tumor initiating cell phenotype, and that it is required downstream of Six1 to induce these phenotypes. Finally, we demonstrate a significant correlation between miR-106b, Six1, and activated TGF-Beta signaling in human breast cancers, and further show that high levels of miR-106b and miR-93 in breast tumors significantly predicts shortened time to relapse. These findings expand the spectrum of oncogenic functions of miR-106b-25, and may provide a novel molecular explanation, through the Six1 regulated miR-106b-25 cluster, by which TGF-Beta signaling shifts from tumor suppressive to tumor promoting.

22293682	Title	miR-10b promotes cell invasion through RhoC-AKT signaling pathway by targeting HOXD10 in gastric cancer.
22293682	Abstract	MicroRNAs play critical roles in tumorigenesis as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors. As a microRNA induced by Twist, miR-10b function as a metastasis driver in different types of cancer, in which the downstream target gene HOXD10 is the main mediator. In gastric tumor species, miR-10b levels were dramatically elevated in lymphoma node metastasis-positive tumor tissues compared with lymphoma node metastasis-free tumor tissues, and were correlated to dowregulation of HOXD10 expression. In gastric cell lines with distinct degrees of differentiation, miR-10b was highly expressed in the cell line with strong metastatic ability. In MNK45 cells, inhibition of miR-10b led to abrogation of cell invasion. While in GES-1 cells, miR-10 overexpression resulted in enhancement of invasiveness through translational inhibition of HOXD10, and constitutive expression of HOXD10 reversed the effects of miR-10b on cell invasion. Furthermore, either knockdown of RhoC or inhibition of AKT activation interfered miR-10-induced invasiveness in GES-1 cells. In summary, these observations suggest that miR-10b can stimulate the upregulation of RhoC and AKT phosphorylation through targeting HOXD10, thus promoting cell invasion in gastric tumors.

22298639	Title	Transcriptional regulation of miR-196b by ETS2 in gastric cancer cells.
22298639	Abstract	E26 transformation-specific sequence (ETS)-2 is a transcriptional modulator located on chromosome 21, alterations in its expression have been implicated with a reduced incidence of solid tumors in Down syndrome patients. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are thought to participate in diverse biological functions; however, the regulation of miRNAs is not well characterized. Recently, we reported that miR-196b is highly expressed in gastric cancers. Herein, we demonstrate that miR-196b expression was significantly repressed by ETS2 during gastric cancer oncogenesis. We demonstrate that knockdown of endogenous ETS2 expression increases miR-196b expression. A genomic region between -751 and -824 bp upstream of the miR-196b transcriptional start site was found to be critical for the repression activity. This putative regulatory promoter region contains three potential ETS2-binding motifs. Mutations within the ETS2 binding sites blocked the repression activity of ETS2. Furthermore, knockdown of ETS2 or overexpression of miR-196b significantly induced migration and invasion in gastric cancer cells. In addition, alterations in ETS2 and miR-196b expression in gastric cancer cell lines affected the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related genes. The levels of vimentin, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP9 were drastically induced, but levels of E-cadherin were decreased in shETS2- or miR-196b-transfected cells. Our data indicate that ETS2 plays a key role in controlling the expression of miR-196b, and miR-196b may mediate the tumor suppressor effects of ETS2. We demonstrated that miR-196b was transcriptionally regulated by ETS2 and there was an inverse expression profile between miR-196b and ETS2 in clinical samples. This finding could be beneficial for the development of effective cancer diagnostic and alternative therapeutic strategies.

22310293	Title	Inhibition of miR-9 de-represses HuR and DICER1 and impairs Hodgkin lymphoma tumour outgrowth in vivo.
22310293	Abstract	MicroRNAs are important regulators of gene expression in normal development and disease. miR-9 is overexpressed in several cancer forms, including brain tumours, hepatocellular carcinomas, breast cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Here we demonstrated a relevance for miR-9 in HL pathogenesis and identified two new targets Dicer1 and HuR. HL is characterized by a massive infiltration of immune cells and fibroblasts in the tumour, whereas malignant cells represent only 1% of the tumour mass. These infiltrates provide important survival and growth signals to the tumour cells, and several lines of evidence indicate that they are essential for the persistence of HL. We show that inhibition of miR-9 leads to derepression of DICER and HuR, which in turn results in a decrease in cytokine production by HL cells followed by an impaired ability to attract normal inflammatory cells. Finally, inhibition of miR-9 by a systemically delivered antimiR-9 in a xenograft model of HL increases the protein levels of HuR and DICER1 and results in decreased tumour outgrowth, confirming that miR-9 actively participates in HL pathogenesis and points to miR-9 as a potential therapeutic target.

22310976	Title	MiR-135a targets JAK2 and inhibits gastric cancer cell proliferation.
22310976	Abstract	The role of tumor suppressors and cell cycle factors in gastric carcinogenesis are well understood; however, the post-transcriptional changes that affect gene expression in gastric cancer are poorly characterized. MiR-135a has been shown to play a role in Hodgkin lymphoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and role of miR-135a in gastric cancer. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that miR-135a expression is downregulated in the majority of human primary gastric cancer tissues (8/11; 73%), compared with pair-matched adjacent non-tumor tissues. Furthermore, compared with the nonmalignant gastric cell line, GES-1, miR-135a expression was substantially downregulated in gastric cancer cell lines of various degrees of differentiation. Target analysis indicated miR-135a directly regulates Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase involved in cytokine receptor signaling pathways. Overexpression of miR-135a significantly downregulated the expression of JAK2 protein and also reduced gastric cancer cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro. MiR-135a-mediated JAK2 downregulation also reduced p-STAT3 activation and cyclin D1 and Bcl-xL protein expression. This study suggests that miR-135a may function as a tumor suppressor via targeting JAK to repress p-STAT3 activation, reduce cyclin D1 and Bcl-xL expression and inhibit gastric cancer cell proliferation. These results imply that novel treatment approaches targeting miR-135a may potentially benefit patients with gastric cancer.

22343731	Title	MiR-196a is upregulated in gastric cancer and promotes cell proliferation by downregulating p27(kip1).
22343731	Abstract	Aberrant expression of miR-196a has been frequently reported in cancer studies. However, the expression and mechanism of its function in gastric cancer remains unclear. Quantitative real-time PCR was carried out to detect the relative expression of miR-196a in gastric cancer cell lines and tissues. SGC7901 cells were treated with miR-196a inhibitors, mimics, or pCDNA/miR-196a to investigate the role of miR-196a in cell proliferation. Higher expression of miR-196a in gastric cancer tissues was associated with tumor size, a higher clinical stage, and was also correlated with shorter overall survival of patients with gastric cancer. Exogenous downregulation of miR-196a expression significantly suppressed the in vitro cell-cycle progression, proliferation, and colony formation of gastric cancer cells, and ectopic miR-196a expression significantly enhanced the development of tumors in nude mice. Luciferase assays revealed that miR-196a inhibited p27(kip1) expression by targeting one binding site in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of p27(kip1) mRNA. qPCR and Western blot assays verified that miR-196a reduced p27(kip1) expression at both mRNA and protein levels. The p27(kip1)-mediated repression in cell proliferation was reverted by exogenous miR-196a expression. A reverse correlation between miR-196a and p27(kip1) expression was noted in gastric cancer tissues. Our study shows that aberrant overexpression of miR-196a and consequent downregulation of p27(kip1) could contribute to gastric carcinogenesis and would be targets for gastric cancer therapies and further developed as potential prognostic factors.

22382630	Title	Role of miR-19b and its target mRNAs in 5-fluorouracil resistance in colon cancer cells.
22382630	Abstract	Drug resistance in colorectal cancers is assumed to be mediated by changes in the expression of microRNAs, but the specific identities and roles of microRNAs are largely unclear. We examined the effect of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) resistance on microRNA expression. Two types of 5-FU-resistant colon cancer cells were derived from the DLD-1 and KM12C cell lines. The expressions of microRNAs were profiled with a microarray containing 723 microRNAs and validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). To survey the downstream mediators of microRNA, we used a microRNA:mRNA immunoprecipitation (RIP)-Chip and pathway analysis tool to identify potential direct targets of microRNA. In response to 5-FU, miR-19b and miR-21 were over-expressed in 5-FU-resistant cells. Of note, miR-19b was up-regulated 3.47-fold in the DLD-1 resistant cells, which exhibited no alteration in cell cycle profiles despite exposure to 5-FU. After transfection of miR-19b, specific mRNAs were recruited to microRNA:mRNA complexes isolated with Ago2 antibody and subjected to whole-genome transcriptional analysis. In this analysis, 66 target mRNAs were enriched by at least 5.0-fold in the microRNA:mRNA complexes from DLD-1 resistant cells. Ingenuity pathway analysis of mRNA targets significantly (P < 0.05) indicated the category "Cell Cycle" as a probable area of the molecular and cellular function related with 5-FU resistance. Among candidate mRNA targets, SFPQ and MYBL2 have been linked to cell cycle functions. We revealed up-regulation of miR-19b in response to 5-FU and potential targets of miR-19b mediating the cell cycle under treatment with 5-FU. Our study provides an important insight into the mechanism of 5-FU resistance in colorectal cancers.

22384930	Title	MicroRNA-193 pro-proliferation effects for bone mesenchymal stem cells after low-level laser irradiation treatment through inhibitor of growth family, member 5.
22384930	Abstract	The enhanced proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be helpful for the clinical translation of cell therapy. Low-level laser irradiation (LLLI) has been demonstrated as regulating MSC proliferation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in various pathophysiologic processes in stem cells, but the role of miRNAs in the LLLI-based promotion of MSC proliferation remains unclear. We found that the proliferation level and cell cycle-associated genes in MSCs were increased after LLLI treatment in a time-dependent manner. Microarray assays revealed subsets of miRNAs to be differentially regulated, and these dynamic changes were confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) after LLLI. miR-193 was the most highly up-regulated miRNA, and the change in it was related with the proliferation level. Gain-loss function experiments demonstrated that miR-193 could regulate the proliferation of MSCs, including human's and rat's, but could not affect the apoptosis and differentiation level. Blockade of miR-193 repressed the MSC proliferation induced by LLLI. By qRT-PCR, we found that miR-193, in particular, regulated cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) expression. Bioinformatic analyses and luciferase reporter assays revealed that inhibitor of growth family, member 5 (ING5) could be the best target of miR-193 to functionally regulate proliferation and CDK2 activity, and the mRNA and protein level of ING5 was regulated by miR-193. Furthermore, the ING5 inhibited by small interfering RNA (siRNA) could up-regulate the proliferation of MSCs and the expression of CDK2. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that miR-193 plays a critical part in MSC proliferation in response to LLLI stimulation, which is potentially amenable to therapeutic manipulation for clinical application.

22402125	Title	miRNA-29b suppresses prostate cancer metastasis by regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition signaling.
22402125	Abstract	Prostate cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths among American men. Early diagnosis increases survival rate in patients; however, treatments for advanced disease are limited to hormone ablation techniques and palliative care. Thus, new methods of treatment are necessary for inhibiting prostate cancer disease progression. Here, we have shown that miRNA-29b (miR-29b) expression was lower in prostate cancer cells (PC3 and LNCaP) as compared with immortalized prostate epithelial cells. Between these two prostate cancer cell lines, metastatic prostate cancer PC3 cells displayed lower expression of miR-29b. We also observed a significant downregulation of miR-29b expression in human prostate cancer tissues as compared with patient-matched nontumor tissues. PC3 cells ectopically expressing miR-29b inhibited wound healing, invasiveness, and failed to colonize in the lungs and liver of severe combined immunodeficient mice after intravenous injection, while PC3 cells expressing a control miRNA displayed metastasis. Epithelial cell marker E-cadherin expression was enhanced miR-29b transfected in prostate cancer cells as compared with cells expressing control miRNA. On the other hand, N-cadherin, Twist, and Snail expression was downregulated in PC3 cells expressing miR-29b. Together these results suggested that miR-29b acts as an antimetastatic miRNA for prostate cancer cells at multiple steps in a metastatic cascade. Therefore, miR-29b could be a potentially new attractive target for therapeutic intervention in prostate cancer.

22402365	Title	MicroRNAs in the growth plate are responsive to nutritional cues: association between miR-140 and SIRT1.
22402365	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be involved in a variety of functions, including skeletal development and longitudinal growth. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miRNAs in food-restriction-induced growth attenuation and nutrition-induced catch-up growth in the epiphyseal growth plate (EGP). Prepubertal rats were fed ad libitum or were subjected to 40% food restriction for 10 days followed by a renewal of the regular food supply. At sacrifice, tibial EGPs were excised, and the total RNA was extracted and loaded on miRNA microarrays. The miRNA microarray yielded more than 400 miRNAs that are expressed in the EGP of mature animals. Results were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Chondrocyte-specific miR-140-3p showed the highest expression in the mature EGP, and it was one of the few miRNAs that were significantly reduced following nutrition restriction. Changes in predicted miRNA targets were then followed with Western immunoblotting. Direct binding was demonstrated using exogenous miRNA, the 3'UTR of the target mRNA and a luciferase reporter assay. Nutrition restriction induced an increase in the level of the miR-140-3p target, NAD+-dependent SIRT1. This study is the first to show that SIRT1 and miRNAs expressed in the mature EGP are responsive to nutritional cues. Nutrition-induced epigenetic regulation of growth activates two parts of the epigenetic world - miRNAs and histone deacetylases - that are interconnected. Deciphering the role of epigenetic regulation in growth may open a new era of research and pave the way for the development of new treatments for children with growth disorders.

22407237	Title	Clinicopathological and prognostic significance of microRNA-107 and its relationship to DICER1 mRNA expression in gastric cancer.
22407237	Abstract	microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate target gene expression. It is known that miRNA-107 (miR-107) promotes cancer invasion and metastasis. However, the relationship between clinicopathological factors and the prognostic significance of miR-107 for gastric cancer patients remains elusive. In this study, we evaluated the prognostic value of miR-107 using tissue samples from gastric cancer patients. Furthermore, the relationship between miR-107 and the mRNA levels of its target gene DICER1 was examined. The expression levels of miR-107 and DICER1 mRNA in tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues of 161 gastric cancer patients were examined (TNM stage I, 29 patients; stage II, 31 patients; stage III, 51 patients and stage IV, 50 patients). miR-107 levels were measured by Taqman microRNA assays, and DICER1 mRNA levels were measured by the Taqman real-time RT-PCR method. In the analysis by real-time PCR-based miRNA arrays using pooled RNA samples from five gastric cancer patients, expression of miR-107, miR-21, miR-196a, miR-26b, miR-9, miR-142-3p, miR-30b, miR-150, miR-191 and miR-17 was found to be upregulation. The mean expression level of miR-107 was significantly higher in the tumor tissues compared to that of normal tissues. In the comparison of clinicopathological factors, miR-107 expression showed significant association with depth of tumor invasion, lymph node metastasis and stage. In Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis, overall survival rates (OS) and disease-free survival rates (DFS) of patients with high miR-107 expression were significantly worse than those of patients with low miR-107 expression. In the Cox multivariate analysis, it was shown that miR-107 expression in gastric cancer tissues was an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS. Significant inverse correlations were demonstrated between miR-107 and DICER1 mRNA. Our results indicate that miR-107 may be useful as an effective biomarker for prediction of a poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients.

22421157	Title	MiRNA-34 intrinsically links p53 tumor suppressor and Wnt signaling.
22421157	Abstract	Though tumor suppressor p53 and the canonical Wnt cascade have been extensively studied for the last 30 years, due to their important physiological roles, the two signaling pathways have been largely considered independent. Recently, the miR-34 family was found to directly link p53 and Wnt, revealing the tight connection between loss of tumor suppressor function and activation of oncogenic signaling. These observations demonstrate that miR-34, known to be directly downstream of p53, targets a set of highly conserved sites in the UTR of Wnt and EMT genes, specifically WNT1, WNT3, LRP6, AXIN2, Beta-catenin, LEF1 and Snail, resulting in suppression of TCF/LEF transcriptional activity and the EMT program. The loss of p53 function increases Wnt activities and promotes the Snail-dependent EMT program at multiple levels in a miR-34/UTR-specific manner. The TCF/LEF transcriptional signature was closely associated with functionality of p53 and miR-34 in clinical samples, suggesting the pervasive impact of miR-34 loss on the oncogenic pathway in human cancer. Here, we review recent findings on ceRNA in light of novel data to elucidate the physiological relevance of the p53-miR-34-Wnt network, which encompasses sets of genes and directions of signaling. As loss of wt-p53 or hyperactivation of Wnt is critical in maintaining cancer stem cell properties and in establishing the metastatic program, these observations indicate a mechanism of miR-mediated quasi-sufficiency which connects tumor suppressor and oncogenic signaling pathways, supporting a continuum model of human cancer.

22426647	Title	microRNA-155 is downregulated in gastric cancer cells and involved in cell metastasis.
22426647	Abstract	microRNA-155 (miR-155), an important multifunctional microRNA, has been implicated in the development of multiple solid tumors, yet, its role in gastric cancer cells has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we find that miR-155 was significantly downregulated in gastric cancer cell lines compared with an immortalized gastric epithelial cell line (GES-1). Overexpression of miR-155 in SGC-7901 and MKN-45 gastric cancer cells dramatically suppressed cell migration, invasion and adhesion in vitro. Overexpression of miR-155 significantly reduced the protein levels of SMAD2 and repressed the activity of a luciferase reporter containing one of the two predicted miR-155 binding sites in SMAD2 3'-UTR, indicating that SMAD2 may be a miR-155 target gene. miR-155 expression was also remarkably restored by a DNA demethylating agent (5-Aza-2-deoxycytidine) in SGC-7901 and MKN-45 gastric cancer cells. Taken together, these data suggest that miR-155 may function as a tumor suppressor to regulate gastric cancer cell metastasis by targeting SMAD2, and its downregulation in gastric cancer cells may be partly ascribed to DNA methylation.

22438124	Title	Delta-tocotrienol suppresses Notch-1 pathway by upregulating miR-34a in nonsmall cell lung cancer cells.
22438124	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that play critical roles in regulating various cellular functions by transcriptional silencing. miRNAs can function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors (oncomirs), depending on cancer types. In our study, using miRNA microarray, we observed that downregulation of the Notch-1 pathway, by delta-tocotrienol, correlated with upregulation of miR-34a, in nonsmall cell lung cancer cells (NSCLC). Moreover, re-expression of miR-34a by transfection in NSCLC cells resulted in inhibition of cell growth and invasiveness, induction of apoptosis and enhanced p53 activity. Furthermore, cellular mechanism studies revealed that induction of miR-34a decreased the expression of Notch-1 and its downstream targets including Hes-1, Cyclin D1, Survivin and Bcl-2. Our findings suggest that delta-tocotrienol is a nontoxic activator of mir-34a which can inhibit NSCLC cell proliferation, induce apoptosis and inhibit invasion, and thus offering a potential starting point for the design of novel anticancer agents.

22450659	Title	miR-124 inhibits cell proliferation in gastric cancer through down-regulation of SPHK1.
22450659	Abstract	SPHK1 expression is elevated in gastric cancer and is associated with shorter survival times for patients. However, the molecular mechanism of SPHK1 up-regulation in gastric cancer remains unclear. In the present study, we report that miR-124 down-regulated SPHK1 expression by directly targeting its 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and that miR-124 expression was inversely correlated with SPHK1 expression in gastric cancer samples. Furthermore, we demonstrated that, similar to the effect of silencing SPHK1, up-regulation of miR-124 markedly inhibited proliferation and tumourigenicity of gastric cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. This was found to be mechanistically associated with induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21$^{{\rm Cip1}}$ and p27$^{{\rm Kip1}}$, enhancement of the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 and suppression of AKT activity. Moreover, we showed that the re-introduction of SPHK1 (without the 3'-UTR), but not with the 3'-UTR, could abrogate the miR-124-mediated induction of p21$^{{\rm Cip1}}$ and p27$^{{\rm Kip1}}$, as well as rescue the miR-124-induced proliferation inhibition. Together, these results suggest that miR-124 has an important role in the suppression of gastric cancer and presents a novel mechanism of miRNA-mediated SPHK1 expression in cancer cells.

22450781	Title	Lack of microRNA-101 causes E-cadherin functional deregulation through EZH2 up-regulation in intestinal gastric cancer.
22450781	Abstract	E-cadherin expression disruption is commonly observed in metastatic epithelial cancers and is a crucial step in gastric cancer (GC) initiation and progression. As aberrant expression of microRNAs often perturb the normal expression/function of pivotal cancer-related genes, we characterized and dissected a pathway that causes E-cadherin dysfunction via loss of microRNA-101 and up-regulation of EZH2 expression in GC. MicroRNA microarray expression profiling and array-CGH were used to reinforce miR-101 involvement in GC. By using quantitative real-time PCR and quantitative SNaPshot genomic PCR, we confirmed that miR-101 was significantly down-regulated in GC (p < 0.0089) in comparison with normal gastric mucosas and, at least in 65% of the GC cases analysed, this down-regulation was caused by deletions and/or microdeletions at miR-101 genomic loci. Moreover, around 40% of cases showing miR-101 down-regulation displayed concomitant EZH2 over-expression (at the RNA and protein levels), which, in turn, was associated with loss/aberrant expression of E-cadherin. Interestingly, this occurred preferentially in intestinal-type GCs, retaining allele(s) untargeted by classical CDH1-inactivating mechanisms. We also demonstrated that miR-101 gain of function or direct inhibition of EZH2 in Kato III GC cells led to a strong depletion of endogenous EZH2 and consequent rescue of E-cadherin membranous localization, mimicking results obtained in clinical GC samples. In conclusion, we show that deletions and/or microdeletions at both miR-101 genomic loci cause mature miR-101 down-regulation, subsequent EZH2 over-expression and E-cadherin dysfunction, specifically in intestinal-type GC.

22452878	Title	Cellular microRNA let-7c inhibits M1 protein expression of the H1N1 influenza A virus in infected human lung epithelial cells.
22452878	Abstract	The influenza virus (IV) triggers a series of signalling events inside host cells and induces complex cellular responses. Studies have suggested that host factors play an essential role in IV replication. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of small non-coding RNAs that target mRNAs, triggering either translation repression or RNA degradation. Emerging research suggests that host-derived cellular miRNAs are involved in mediating the host-IV interaction. Using miRNA microarrays, we identified several miRNAs aberrantly expressed in IV-infected human lung epithelial cells (A549). Specifically, miR-let-7c was highly up-regulated in IV-infected A549 cells. PITA and miRanda database screening indicated that the let-7c seed sequence is a perfect complementary sequence match to the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of viral gene M1 (+) cRNA, but not to PB2 and PA. As detected by a luciferase reporter system, let-7c directly targeted the 3'-UTR of M1 (+) cRNA, but not PB2 and PA. To experimentally identify the function of cellular let-7c, precursor let-7c was transfected into A549 cells. Let-7c down-regulated IV M1 expression at both the (+) cRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, transfection with a let-7c inhibitor enhanced the expression of M1. Therefore, let-7c may reduce IV replication by degrading M1 (+) cRNA. This is the first report indicating that cellular miRNA regulates IV replication through the degradation of viral gene (+) cRNA by matching the 3'-UTR of the viral cRNA. These findings suggest that let-7c plays a role in protecting host cells from the virus in addition to its known cellular functions.

22454525	Title	MicroRNA-378a-5p promotes trophoblast cell survival, migration and invasion by targeting Nodal.
22454525	Abstract	Nodal is a member of the transforming growth factor-Beta superfamily that plays crucial roles during embryogenesis. Recently, we have reported that Nodal inhibits trophoblast cell proliferation, migration and invasion, but induces apoptosis in the human placenta. In this study, we examined the regulation of Nodal by microRNAs. In silico analysis of Nodal 3'UTR revealed a potential binding site for miR-378a-5p. In luciferase reporter assays, we found that miR-378a-5p suppressed the luciferase activity of a reporter plasmid containing Nodal 3'UTR but this suppressive effect was completely abolished when the predicted target site was mutated. Western blot analysis showed that miR-378a-5p decreased whereas anti-miR-378a-5p increased Nodal protein levels. These results indicate that miR-378a-5p targets Nodal 3'UTR to repress its expression. Stable transfection of the miR-378a-5p precursor, mir-378a, into HTR8/SVneo cells enhanced cell survival, proliferation, migration and invasion. Transient transfection of mature miR-378a-5p mimic, and to a lesser extent, siRNA targeting Nodal, produced similar effects. However, anti-miR-378a-5p inhibited cell migration and invasion. In addition, overexpression of Nodal reversed the invasion-promoting effect of miR-378a-5p. Furthermore, miR-378a-5p enhanced, whereas anti-miR-378a-5p suppressed, the outgrowth and spreading of extravillous trophoblast cells in first trimester placental explants. Finally, miR-378a-5p was detected in human placenta throughout different stages of gestation and in preterm pregnancies, placental miR-378a-5p levels were lower in preeclamptic patients than in healthy controls. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that miR-378a-5p plays an important role in human placental development by regulating trophoblast cell growth, survival, migration and invasion, and that miR-378a-5p exerts these effects, at least in part, through the suppression of Nodal expression.

22464652	Title	MicroRNA-21 inhibits Serpini1, a gene with novel tumour suppressive effects in gastric cancer.
22464652	Abstract	A thorough understanding of gastric cancer at the molecular level is urgently needed. One prominent oncogenic microRNA, miR-21, was previously reported to be upregulated in gastric cancer. We performed an unbiased search for downstream messenger RNA targets of miR-21, based on miR-21 dysregulation, by using human tissue specimens and the MKN28 human gastric carcinoma cell line. Molecular techniques include microRNA microarrays, cDNA microarrays, qRT-PCR for miR and mRNA expression, transfection of MKN28 with miR-21 inhibitor or Serpini1 followed by Western blotting, cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry and luciferase reporter assay. This search identified Serpini1 as a putative miR-21 target. Luciferase assays demonstrated direct interaction between miR-21 and Serpini1 3'UTR. miR-21 and Serpini1 expression levels were inversely correlated in a subgroup of gastric cancers, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that included both of these molecules. Furthermore, Serpini1 induced growth retardation of MKN28 and induced vigorous G1/S arrest suggesting its potential tumour-suppressive function in the stomach. Taken together, these data suggest that in a subgroup of gastric cancers, miR-21 is upregulated, inducing downregulation of Serpini1, which in turn releases the G1-S transition checkpoint, with the end result being increased tumour growth.

22469786	Title	miR-495 and miR-551a inhibit the migration and invasion of human gastric cancer cells by directly interacting with PRL-3.
22469786	Abstract	The phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3) gene is associated with metastasis in gastric cancer, and is believed to play a causative role by promoting tumor cell motility, invasion, and metastasis, but little is known of the mechanisms involved. We previously reported that PRL-3 expression is significantly higher in the tissues of primary gastric carcinomas with peritoneal metastasis. In the present study, we found that two microRNAs (miRNAs), miR-495 and miR-551a, predicted to target PRL-3, are downregulated in gastric carcinoma samples. The validation of this interaction between those two miRNAs and PRL-3 was confirmed by western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) in GC cell lines transfected with miR-495 and miR-551a mimics. Furthermore, the migration and invasion of GC cells were significantly inhibited by transfection with miR-495 or -551a mimics, and the mRNA and protein levels of PRL-3 were reduced in cells overexpressing miR-495 or -551a. Collectively, our findings suggest that miR-495 and miR-551a both act as tumor suppressors by targeting the PRL-3 oncogene and inhibiting gastric cancer cell migration and invasion. The findings of this study contribute to current understanding of the functions of miRNA mimics in GC gene therapy.

22482882	Title	Concomitant activation of miR-107/PDCD10 and hypoxamir-210/Casp8ap2 and their role in cytoprotection during ischemic preconditioning of stem cells.
22482882	Abstract	To establish a functional link between microRNA-107 (miR-107) and stem cell survival during ischemic preconditioning (IPC) of stem cells with multiple cycles of brief anoxia/re-oxygenation (10 or 30 min, one to three cycles) and show that the cytoprotective effects were independent of hypoxamir-210. We demonstrated the induction of miR-107 in response to the IPC-induced activation of Akt/hypoxia inducible factor-1Alpha (HIF-1Alpha) in preconditioned mesenchymal stem cells ((PC)MSC), which showed improved survival during subsequent exposure to 6 h of lethal anoxia (p<0.05 vs. non-preconditioned MSC[(non-PC)MSC]). In silico analysis and luciferase activity assay confirmed programmed cell death-10 (PDCD10) as a putative target of miR-107 in (PC)MSC, which was significantly reduced during IPC and inversely related to stem cell survival under 6 h of lethal anoxia. Loss-of-function studies with miR-107 antagomir showed a significantly reduced survival of (PC)MSC. A comparison of miR-107 and miR-210 showed that both miRs participated independently via their respective putative target genes Pdcd10 and Casp8ap2. The simultaneous abrogation of Pdcd10 and Casp8ap2 had a stronger effect on (PC)MSC survival under lethal anoxia. The transplantation of (PC)MSC in an acute model of myocardial infarction showed a significantly improved survival of transplanted (PC)MSC with concomitantly enhanced miR-107 expression in (PC)MSC-transplanted animal hearts. Cytoprotection afforded by IPC is regulated by miR-107 induction via Pdcd10 independent of miR-210/Casp8ap2 signaling, and the simultaneous abrogation miR-107/miR-210 has a stronger effect on the loss of (PC)MSC survival. IPC enhances stem cell survival via the combined participation of hypoxia responsive miRs miR-107 and miR-210 via their respective putative target genes Pdcd10 and Casp8ap2.

22525276	Title	The miR-99 family regulates the DNA damage response through its target SNF2H.
22525276	Abstract	Chromatin remodeling factors are becoming known as crucial facilitators of recruitment of repair proteins to sites of DNA damage. Multiple chromatin remodeling protein complexes are now known to be required for efficient double strand break repair. In a screen for microRNAs (miRNAs) that modulate the DNA damage response, we discovered that expression of the miR-99 family of miRNAs correlates with radiation sensitivity. These miRNAs were also transiently induced following radiation. The miRNAs target the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling factor SNF2H/SMARCA5, a component of the ACF1 complex. We found that by reducing levels of SNF2H, miR-99a and miR-100 reduced BRCA1 localization to sites of DNA damage. Introduction of the miR-99 family of miRNAs into cells reduced the rate and overall efficiency of repair by both homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. Finally, induction of the miR-99 family following radiation prevents an increase in SNF2H expression and reduces the recruitment of BRCA1 to the sites of DNA damage following a second dose of radiation, reducing the efficiency of repair after multiple rounds of radiation, as used in fractionated radiotherapy.

22539488	Title	MicroRNA-181b targets cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 in gastric adenocarcinomas.
22539488	Abstract	MicroRNAs are a class of small endogenous non-coding RNAs that function as post-transcriptional regulators. In our previous study, we found that miR-181b was significantly downregulated in human gastric adenocarcinoma tissue samples compared to the adjacent normal gastric tissues. In this study, we confirm the down-regulation of miR-181b in human gastric cancer cell lines versus the gastric epithelial cells. Overexpression of miR-181b suppressed the proliferation and colony formation rate of gastric cancer cells. miR-181b downregulated the expression of cAMP responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1) by binding its 3' untranslated region. Overexpression of CREB1 counteracted the suppression of growth in gastric cancer cells caused by ectopic expression of miR-181b. These results indicate that miR-181b may function as a tumor suppressor in gastric adenocarcinoma cells through negative regulation of CREB1.

22541023	Title	Identification of a novel microRNA that regulates the proliferation and differentiation in muscle side population cells.
22541023	Abstract	Muscle satellite cells are largely responsible for skeletal muscle regeneration following injury. Side population (SP) cells, which are thought to be muscle stem cells, also contribute to muscle regeneration. SP cells exhibit high mesenchymal potential, and are a possible cell source for therapy of muscular dystrophy. However, the mechanism by which muscle SP cells are committed to differentiation is poorly understood. microRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in modulating a variety of cellular processes through repression of their mRNA targets. In skeletal muscle, miRNAs are known to be involved in myoblast proliferation and differentiation. To investigate mechanisms of SP cell regulation, we profiled miRNA expression in SP cells and main population (MP) cells in muscles using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction-based expression assays. We identified a set of miRNAs that was highly expressed in SP cells as compared with MP cells. One miRNA, miR-128a, was elevated in expression in SP cells, but decreased in expression during continued culture in vitro. Overexpression of miR-128a in SP cells resulted in inhibited cell proliferation. The differentiation potential of SP cells was also decreased when miR-128a was overexpressed. MiR-128a was found to regulate the target genes involved in the regulation of adipogenic-, osteogenic- and myogenic genes that include: PPARGamma, Runx1, and Pax3. Overexpression of miR-128a suppressed the activity of a luciferase reporter fused to the 3'-untranslated region of each gene. These results demonstrate that miR-128a contributes to the maintenance of the quiescent state, and it regulates cellular differentiation by repressing individual genes in SP cells.

22545247	Title	Regulation of monocyte functional heterogeneity by miR-146a and Relb.
22545247	Abstract	Monocytes serve as a central defense system against infection and injury but can also promote pathological inflammatory responses. Considering the evidence that monocytes exist in at least two subsets committed to divergent functions, we investigated whether distinct factors regulate the balance between monocyte subset responses in vivo. We identified a microRNA (miRNA), miR-146a, which is differentially regulated both in mouse (Ly-6C(hi)/Ly-6C(lo)) and human (CD14(hi)/CD14(lo)CD16(+)) monocyte subsets. The single miRNA controlled the amplitude of the Ly-6C(hi) monocyte response during inflammatory challenge whereas it did not affect Ly-6C(lo) cells. miR-146a-mediated regulation was cell-intrinsic and depended on Relb, a member of the noncanonical NF-KappaB/Rel family, which we identified as a direct miR-146a target. These observations not only provide mechanistic insights into the molecular events that regulate responses mediated by committed monocyte precursor populations but also identify targets for manipulating Ly-6C(hi) monocyte responses while sparing Ly-6Clo monocyte activity.

22552637	Title	Overexpression of Arabidopsis miR157b induces bushy architecture and delayed phase transition in Torenia fournieri.
22552637	Abstract	miR156/157 is a small RNA molecule that is highly conserved among various plant species. Overexpression of miR156/157 has been reported to induce bushy architecture and delayed phase transition in several plant species. To investigate the effect of miR157 overexpression in a horticultural plant, and to explore the applicability of miRNA to molecular breeding, we introduced Arabidopsis MIR157b (AtMIR157b) into torenia (Torenia fournieri). The resulting 35S:AtMIR157b plants showed a high degree of branching along with small leaves, which resembled miR156/157-overexpressing plants of other species. We also isolated torenia SBP-box genes with target miR156/157 sequences and confirmed that their expression was selectively downregulated in 35S:AtMIR157b plants. The reduced accumulation of mRNA was probably due to sequence specificity. Moreover, expression of torenia homologs of the SBP-box protein-regulated genes TfLFY and TfMIR172 was also reduced by AtmiR157 overexpression. These findings suggest that the molecular mechanisms of miR156/157 regulation are conserved between Arabidopsis and torenia. The bushy architecture and small leaves of 35S:AtMIR157b torenia plants could be applied in molecular breeding of various horticultural plants as well as for increasing biomass and crop production.

22555458	Title	miR-205 regulates basement membrane deposition in human prostate: implications for cancer development.
22555458	Abstract	The basement membrane (BM) is a layer of specialized extracellular matrix that surrounds normal prostate glands and preserves tissue integrity. Lack or discontinuity of the BM is a prerequisite for tumor cell invasion into interstitial spaces, thus favoring metastasis. Therefore, BM maintenance represents a barrier against cancer development and progression. In the study, we show that miR-205 participates in a network involving DeltaNp63Alpha, which is essential for maintenance of the BM in prostate epithelium. At the molecular level, DeltaNp63Alpha is able to enhance miR-205 transcription by binding to its promoter, whereas the microRNA can post-transcriptionally limit the amount of DeltaNp63Alpha protein, mostly by affecting DeltaNp63Alpha proteasomal degradation rather than through a canonical miRNA/target interaction. Functionally, miR-205 is able to control the deposition of laminin-332 and its receptor integrin-Beta4. Hence, pathological loss of miR-205, as widely observed in prostate cancer, may favor tumorigenesis by creating discontinuities in the BM. Here we demonstrate that therapeutic replacement of miR-205 in prostate cancer (PCa) cells can restore BM deposition and 3D organization into normal-like acinar structures, thus hampering cancer progression.

22580605	Title	Inhibition of autophagy and tumor growth in colon cancer by miR-502.
22580605	Abstract	Autophagy is a catabolic process that allows cellular macromolecules to be broken down and recycled as metabolic precursors. The influence of non-coding microRNAs in autophagy has not been explored in colon cancer. In this study, we discover a novel mechanism of autophagy regulated by hsa-miR-502-5p (miR-502) by suppression of Rab1B, a critical mediator of autophagy. A number of other miR-502 suppressed mRNA targets (for example, dihydroorotate dehydrogenase) are also identified by microarray analysis. Ectopic expression of miR-502 inhibited autophagy, colon cancer cell growth and cell-cycle progression of colon cancer cells in vitro. miR-502 also inhibited in-vivo colon cancer growth in a mouse tumor xenografts model. In addition, the expression of miR-502 was regulated by p53 via a negative feedback regulatory mechanism. The expression of miR-502 was downregulated in colon cancer patient specimens compared with the paired normal control samples. These results suggest that miR-502 may function as a potential tumor suppressor and therefore be a novel candidate for developing miR-502-based therapeutic strategies.

22582938	Title	Aberrant microRNA-182 expression is associated with glucocorticoid resistance in lymphoblastic malignancies.
22582938	Abstract	Glucocorticoid (GC) resistance in lymphoblastic malignancies is related to treatment failure and is a marker of poor prognosis. Previous studies have suggested that microRNA-182 (miR-182) functions as an oncogene and plays a role in tumorigenesis, through regulation of FOXO3A. FOXO3A has been implicated in tumor suppression and GC-induced apoptosis, suggesting that FOXO3A has potential as a therapeutic target. Herein we investigated the role of miR-182 in GC sensitivity in lymphoblastic malignancies. Expression of miR-182 was consistently higher in human and mouse GC-resistant cell lines than in GC-sensitive cell lines. Furthermore, increased expression of miR-182 reduced total FOXO3A expression but had no significant effect on phospho-FOXO3A. Additionally Bim, as a downstream target of FOXO3A, was reduced by overexpression of miR-182, and increased by down-regulation of miR-182. These results demonstrate that miR-182 is involved in glucocorticoid resistance, via targeting of FOXO3A, and that restoration of miR-182 is a potentially promising therapeutic strategy in lymphoblastic malignancies.

22585994	Title	MYC is activated by USP2a-mediated modulation of microRNAs in prostate cancer.
22585994	Abstract	Ubiquitin-specific protease 2a (USP2a) is overexpressed in almost half of human prostate cancers and c-Myc is amplified in one third of these tumor types. Transgenic MYC expression drives invasive adenocarcinomas in the murine prostate. We show that overexpression of USP2a downregulates a set of microRNAs that collectively increase MYC levels by MDM2 deubiquitination and subsequent p53 inactivation. By establishing MYC as a target of miR-34b/c, we demonstrate that this cluster functions as a tumor suppressor in prostate cancer cells. We identify a distinct mRNA signature that is enriched for MYC-regulated transcripts and transcription factor binding sites in USP2a overexpressing prostate cancer cells. We demonstrate that these genes are associated with an invasive phenotype in human prostate cancer and that the proliferative and invasive properties of USP2a overexpressing cells are MYC-dependent. These results highlight an unrecognized mechanism of MYC regulation in prostate cancer and suggest alternative therapeutic strategies in targeting MYC. The deubiquitinating enzyme USP2a has previously been shown to be oncogenic, overexpressed in almost half of human prostate adenocarcinomas, and prolongs the half-life of targets such as fatty acid synthase, MDM2, and cyclin D1. Here, we highlight a new mechanism by which USP2a enhances MYC levels through the modulation of specific subsets of microRNAs in prostate cancer, suggesting alternative therapeutic strategies for targeting MYC.

22595520	Title	Regulation of multiple target genes by miR-1 and miR-206 is pivotal for C2C12 myoblast differentiation.
22595520	Abstract	MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs involved in post-transcriptional regulation of multiple messenger RNA targets. The miR-1/miR-206 family is expressed during skeletal muscle differentiation and is an integral component of myogenesis. To better understand miR-1/miR-206 function during myoblast differentiation we identified novel target mRNAs by microarray and characterized their function in C2C12 myoblasts. Candidate targets from the screen were experimentally validated together with target genes that were predicted by three different algorithms. Some targets characterised have a known function in skeletal muscle development and/or differentiation and include Meox2, RARB, Fzd7, MAP4K3, CLCN3 and NFAT5, others are potentially novel regulators of myogenesis, such as the chromatin remodelling factors Smarcd2 and Smarcb1 or the anti-apoptotic protein SH3BGRL3. The expression profiles of confirmed target genes were examined during C2C12 cell myogenesis. We found that inhibition of endogenous miR-1 and miR-206 by antimiRs blocked the downregulation of most targets in differentiating cells, thus indicating that microRNA activity and target interaction is required for muscle differentiation. Finally, we show that sustained expression of validated miR-1 and/or miR-206 targets resulted in increased proliferation and inhibition of C2C12 cell myogenesis. In many cases the expression of genes related to non-muscle cell fates, such as chondrogenesis, was activated. This indicates that the concerted downregulation of multiple microRNA targets is not only crucial to the skeletal muscle differentiation program but also serves to prevent alternative cell fate choices.

22610915	Title	Hepatitis C virus-induced up-regulation of microRNA-155 promotes hepatocarcinogenesis by activating Wnt signaling.
22610915	Abstract	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection usually induces chronic hepatic inflammation, which favors the initiation and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Moreover, microRNA-155 (miR-155) plays an important role in regulating both inflammation and tumorigenesis. However, little is known about whether and how miR-155 provides the link between inflammation and cancer. In this study we found that miR-155 levels were markedly increased in patients infected with HCV. MiR-155 transcription was regulated by nuclear factor kappa B (NF-KappaB), and p300 increased NF-KappaB-dependent miR-155 expression. The overexpression of miR-155 significantly inhibited hepatocyte apoptosis and promoted cell proliferation, whereas miR-155 inhibition induced G(0) /G(1) arrest. Up-regulated miR-155 resulted in nuclear accumulation of Beta-catenin and a concomitant increase in cyclin D1, c-myc, and survivin. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that miR-155 promoted hepatocyte proliferation and tumorigenesis by increasing Wnt signaling in vitro and in vivo, and DKK1 (Wnt pathway inhibitor) overexpression inhibited the biological role of miR-155 in hepatocytes. Finally, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), which negatively regulates Wnt signaling, was identified as the direct and functional target of miR-155. HCV-induced miR-155 expression promotes hepatocyte proliferation and tumorigenesis by activating Wnt signaling. The present study provides a better understanding of the relationship between inflammation and tumorigenesis, and thus may be helpful in the development of effective diagnosis and treatment strategies against HCV-HCC.

22613005	Title	MicroRNA-214 downregulation contributes to tumor angiogenesis by inducing secretion of the hepatoma-derived growth factor in human hepatoma.
22613005	Abstract	Unusual hypervascularity is a hallmark of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although microRNA-214 (miR-214) is upregulated in other human cancers, it is downregulated in HCC. We elucidated the biological and clinical significance of miR-214 downregulation in HCC. MicroRNAs deregulated in HCC were identified using array-based microRNA profiling. A luciferase reporter assay confirmed target association between miR-214 and the hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF). Tube formation and in vivo angiogenesis assays validated the roles of miR-214/HDGF in angiogenesis. miR-214 downregulation was associated with higher tumor recurrence and worse clinical outcomes. Ectopic expression of miR-214 suppressed xenograft tumor growth and microvascularity of the tumors and their surrounding tissues. The genes downregulated by ectopic expression of miR-214 were involved in the regulation of apoptosis, cell cycle, and angiogenesis. Integrated analysis disclosed HDGF as a downstream target of miR-214. Conditioned medium of HCC cells contained bioactivity to stimulate tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which was abolished by pretreatment of the conditioned media with HDGF antibodies, suppression of HDGF expression or ectopic expression of miR-214 in the donor HCC cells. The angiogenic activity of the conditioned media, lost by ectopic expression of miR-214 in the donor cells, was restored by supplementation with recombinant HDGF. In vivo tumor angiogenesis assays showed significant suppression of tumor vascularity by ectopic expression of miR-214. A novel role of microRNA in tumorigenesis is identified. Downregulation of miR-214 contributes to the unusual hypervascularity of HCC via activation of the HDGF paracrine pathway for tumor angiogenesis.

22628193	Title	miR-301a promotes pancreatic cancer cell proliferation by directly inhibiting Bim expression.
22628193	Abstract	It is well known that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in many diseases, including tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms by which miRNAs regulate pancreatic cancer (PC) development remain poorly understood. In the present study, we assayed expression level of miR-301a in PC tissues by real-time PCR, and defined the target gene and biological function by luciferase reporter assay and Western blot analysis. We first verified that the expression level of miR-301a was significantly increased in PC tissues. Moreover, miR-301a overexpression promoted PC cell proliferation, whereas its depletion decreased cell proliferation. We further demonstrated that miR-301a directly targeted 3'-UTR of Bim gene, and inhibited its protein expression in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, Bim re-expression reduced PC cell proliferation induced by miR-301a. These data suggest an important role of miR-301a in the molecular etiology of PC and implicate the potential application of miR-301a in PC therapy.

22647547	Title	Compromised autophagy by MIR30B benefits the intracellular survival of Helicobacter pylori.
22647547	Abstract	Helicobacter pylori evade immune responses and achieve persistent colonization in the stomach. However, the mechanism by which H. pylori infections persist is not clear. In this study, we showed that MIR30B is upregulated during H. pylori infection of an AGS cell line and human gastric tissues. Upregulation of MIR30B benefited bacterial replication by compromising the process of autophagy during the H. pylori infection. As a potential mechanistic explanation for this observation, we demonstrate that MIR30B directly targets ATG12 and BECN1, which are important proteins involved in autophagy. These results suggest that compromise of autophagy by MIR30B allows intracellular H. pylori to evade autophagic clearance, thereby contributing to the persistence of H. pylori infections.

22660396	Title	Specific alterations of the microRNA transcriptome and global network structure in colorectal cancer after treatment with MAPK/ERK inhibitors.
22660396	Abstract	The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway has a master control role in various cancer-related biological processes as cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. It also regulates many transcription factors that control microRNAs (miRNAs) and their biosynthetic machinery. To investigate on the still poorly characterised global involvement of miRNAs within the pathway, we profiled the expression of 745 miRNAs in three colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines after blocking the pathway with three different inhibitors. This allowed the identification of two classes of post-treatment differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs: (1) common DE miRNAs in all CRC lines after treatment with a specific inhibitor (class A); (2) DE miRNAs in a single CRC line after treatment with all three inhibitors (class B). By determining the molecular targets, biological roles, network position of chosen miRNAs from class A (miR-372, miR-663b, miR-1226*) and class B (miR-92a-1*, miR-135b*, miR-720), we experimentally demonstrated that they are involved in cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and globally affect the regulation circuits centred on MAPK/ERK signaling. Interestingly, the levels of miR-92a-1*, miR-135b*, miR-372, miR-720 are significantly higher in biopsies from CRC patients than in normal controls; they also are significantly higher in CRC patients with mutated KRAS than in those with wild-type genotypes (Wilcoxon test, p < 0.05): the latter could be a downstream effect of ERK pathway overactivation, triggered by KRAS mutations. Finally, our functional data strongly suggest the following miRNA/target pairs: miR-92a-1*/PTEN-SOCS5; miR-135b*/LATS2; miR-372/TXNIP; miR-663b/CCND2. Altogether, these results contribute to deepen current knowledge on still uncharacterized features of MAPK/ERK pathway, pinpointing new oncomiRs in CRC and allowing their translation into clinical practice and CRC therapy.

22664914	Title	MicroRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression is affected by disease-associated SNPs within the 3'-UTR via altered RNA structure.
22664914	Abstract	Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in microRNAs (miRNAs) or their target sites (miR-SNPs) within the 3'-UTR of mRNAs are increasingly thought to play a major role in pathological dysregulation of gene expression. Here, we studied the functional role of miR-SNPs on miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. First, analyses were performed on a SNP located in the miR-155 target site within the 3'-UTR of the Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1; rs5186, A > C) mRNA. Second, a SNP in the 3'-UTR of the muscle RAS oncogene homolog (MRAS; rs9818870, C > T) mRNA was studied which is located outside of binding sites of miR-195 and miR-135. Using these SNPs we investigated their effects on local RNA structure, on local structural accessibility and on functional miRNA binding, respectively. Systematic computational RNA folding analyses of the allelic mRNAs in either case predicted significant changes of local RNA structure in the vicinity of the cognate miRNA binding sites. Consistently, experimental in vitro probing of RNA showing differential cleavage patterns and reporter gene-based assays indicated functional differences of miRNA-mediated regulation of the two AGTR1 and MRAS alleles. In conclusion, we describe a novel model explaining the functional influence of 3'-UTR-located SNPs on miRNA-mediated control of gene expression via SNP-related changes of local RNA structure in non-coding regions of mRNA. This concept substantially extends the meaning of disease-related SNPs identified in non protein-coding transcribed sequences within or close to miRNA binding sites.

22664953	Title	MicroRNA-1 and microRNA-499 downregulate the expression of the ets1 proto-oncogene in HepG2 cells.
22664953	Abstract	MicroRNAs may function to promote or suppress tumor development, depending on the cellular context. The important role of microRNAs in regulating molecular pathways underlying tumorigenesis has been emphasized in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MicroRNAs regulate gene expression via post-transcriptional mechanisms by inhibiting translation or by degrading mRNA. In this study, we show that microRNA-1 (miR-1) and microRNA-499 (miR-499) are capable of repressing the expression of the ets1 proto-oncogene, which plays a fundamental role in the extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, a process required for tumor cell invasion and migration. We used luciferase reporter assays to demonstrate that miR-1 and miR-499 target the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of ets1. Overexpression of miR-1 and miR-499 in HepG2 cells led to downregulation of ets1 mRNA and protein as assessed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and western blot analysis. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-1 and miR-499 inhibited the invasion and migration of HepG2 cells in matrigel invasion and transwell migration assays, respectively. These results suggest that miR-1 and miR-499 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of HCC by regulating ets1.

22674011	Title	Brief report: amelioration of collagen-induced arthritis in mice by lentivirus-mediated silencing of microRNA-223.
22674011	Abstract	MicroRNA (miRNA) plays a role in autoimmune diseases. MiRNA-223 (miR-223) is up-regulated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is involved in osteoclastogenesis, which contributes to erosive disease. The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of using lentiviral vectors expressing the miR-223 target sequence (miR-223T) to suppress miR-223 activity as a therapeutic strategy in a mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Levels of miR-223 in the synovial tissue of patients with RA or osteoarthritis (OA), as well as in the ankle joints of mice with CIA, were determined by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Lentiviral vectors expressing miR-223T (LVmiR-223T) or luciferase short hairpin RNA (LVshLuc) as a control vector were injected intraperitoneally into mice with CIA. Treatment responses and disease-related bone mineral density were monitored. Levels of nuclear factor 1A (NF-1A), a direct target of miR-223, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR), which is critical for osteoclastogenesis, were measured by immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR. Osteoclasts were assessed by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining. MiR-223 expression was significantly higher in the synovium of RA patients and in the ankle joints of mice with CIA as compared to OA patients and normal mice. LVmiR-223T treatment reduced the arthritis score, histologic score, miR-223 expression, osteoclastogenesis, and bone erosion in mice with CIA. Down-regulation of miR-223 with concomitant increases in NF-1A levels and decreases in M-CSFR levels was detected in the synovium of LVmiR-223T-treated mice. This study is the first to demonstrate that lentivirus-mediated silencing of miR-223 can reduce disease severity of experimental arthritis. Furthermore, our results indicate that inhibition of miR-223 activity should be further explored as a therapeutic strategy in RA.

22678827	Title	MicroRNA 26b encoded by the intron of small CTD phosphatase (SCP) 1 has an antagonistic effect on its host gene.
22678827	Abstract	Tissue-specific patterns of gene expression play an important role in the distinctive features of each organ. Small CTD phosphatases (SCPs) 1-3 are recruited by repressor element 1 (RE-1)-silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) to neuronal genes that contain RE-1 elements, leading to neuronal gene silencing in non-neuronal cells. SCPs are highly expressed in the heart and contain microRNAs (miR)-26b, 26a-2, and 26a-1 with the same seed sequence in their introns. Therefore, we tried to investigate the roles of miR-26b and its host gene in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Overexpression of miR-26b suppressed the mRNA expression levels of ANF, BetaMHC, and ACTA1 and reduced the cell surface area in cardiomyocytes. We confirmed that miR-26b targets the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of GATA4 and canonical transient receptor potential channel (TRPC) 3. Conversely, silencing of the endogenous miR-26b family enhanced the expression levels of TRPC3 and GATA4. On the other hand, overexpression of SCP1 induced the mRNA expression of ANF and BetaMHC and increased the cell surface area in cardiomyocytes. Next, we compared the effect of overexpression of SCP1 with its introns and SCP1 cDNA to observe the net function of SCP1 expression on cardiac hypertrophy. When the expression levels of SCP1 were the same, the overexpression of SCP1 cDNA had a greater effect at inducing cardiac hypertrophy than SCP1 cDNA with its intron. In conclusion, SCP1 itself has the potential to induce cardiac hypertrophy; however, the effect is suppressed by intronic miR-26b in cardiomyocytes. miR-26b has an antagonistic effect on its host gene SCP1.

22683180	Title	Aberrant expression of microRNAs in gastric cancer and biological significance of miR-574-3p.
22683180	Abstract	The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) provides a new and powerful tool for studying the mechanisms, diagnosis and treatments of cancer. In this study, we employed AFFX miRNA expression chips to search for miRNAs that may be aberrantly expressed in gastric cancer tissues and to investigate the potential roles that miRNAs may play in the development and progression of gastric cancer. 14 miRNAs were found to be down-regulated and 2 miRNAs up-regulated in gastric cancer tissues compared to the normal gastric tissues. Among the aberrantly expressed miRNAs, miR-574-3p was selected to further study its expression features and functional roles. Interestingly, the reduced expression of miR-574-3p occurred mainly in the early stages of gastric cancer or in cancers with high level of differentiation, suggesting that it can be used as a marker for a mild case of gastric cancer. Functional study revealed that cell proliferation, migration and invasion were significantly inhibited in miR-574-3p-transfected gastric cancer SGC7901 cells. Computational prediction and experimental validation suggest that Cullin2 may be one of the targets of miR-574-3p. Overall our study suggests that the aberrantly expressed miRNAs may play regulatory and functional roles in the development and progression of gastric cancer.

22696098	Title	MiR-138 promotes induced pluripotent stem cell generation through the regulation of the p53 signaling.
22696098	Abstract	Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, especially those reprogrammed from patient somatic cells, have a great potential usage in regenerative medicine. The expression of p53 has been proven as a key barrier limiting iPS cell generation, but how p53 is regulated during cell reprogramming remains unclear. In this study, we found that the ectopic expression of miR-138 significantly improved the efficiency of iPS cell generation via Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4, with or without c-Myc (named as OSKM or OSK, respectively), without sacrificing the pluripotent characteristics of the generated iPS cells. Exploration of the mechanism showed that miR-138 directly targeted the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of p53, significantly decreasing the expression of p53 and its downstream genes. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of p53 having a mutant 3'-UTR, which cannot be bound by miR-138, seriously impaired the effect of miR-138 on p53 signaling and OSKM-initiated somatic cell reprogramming. Combined with the fact that miR-138 is endogenously expressed in fibroblasts, iPS cells, and embryonic stem cells, our study demonstrated that regulation of the p53 signaling pathway and promotion of iPS cell generation represent an unrevealed important function of miR-138.

22696253	Title	microRNA-124 regulates cardiomyocyte differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells via targeting STAT3 signaling.
22696253	Abstract	Accumulating evidence demonstrated that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) may transdifferentiate into cardiomyocytes and replace apoptotic myocardium so as to improve functions of damaged hearts. However, little information is known about molecular mechanisms underlying myogenic conversion of BMSCs. microRNAs as endogenous noncoding small molecules function to inhibit protein translation post-transcriptionally by binding to complementary sequences of targeted mRNAs. Here, we reported that miR-124 was remarkably downregulated during cardiomyocyte differentiation of BMSCs induced by coculture with cardiomyocytes. Forced expression of miR-124 led to a significant downregulation of cardiac-specific markers-ANP, TNT, and Alpha-MHC proteins as well as reduction of cardiac potassium channel currents in cocultured BMSCs. On the contrary, the inhibition of endogenous miR-124 with its antisense oligonucleotide AMO-124 obviously reversed the changes of ANP, TNT, and Alpha-MHC proteins and increased cardiac potassium channel currents. Further study revealed that miR-124 targeted the 3'UTR of STAT3 gene so as to suppress the expression of STAT3 protein but did not affect its mRNA level. STAT3 inhibitors AG490, WP1066, and S3I-201 were shown to attenuate the augmented expression of ANP, TNT, Alpha-MHC, GATA-4 proteins, and mRNAs in cocultured BMSCs with AMO-124 transfection. Moreover, GATA-4 siRNA reduced the expression of ANP, TNT, Alpha-MHC, and GATA-4 proteins but did not impact STAT3 protein in cocultured BMSCs, indicating GATA-4 serves as an effector of STAT3. In summary, we found that miR-124 regulated myogenic differentiation of BMSCs via targeting STAT3 mRNA, which provides new insights into molecular mechanisms of cardiomyogenesis of BMSCs.

22713668	Title	MicroRNA-203 suppresses cell proliferation and migration by targeting BIRC5 and LASP1 in human triple-negative breast cancer cells.
22713668	Abstract	This study was performed to investigate the effect of microRNA-203 (miR-203) on cell proliferation and migration in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Real-time PCR was performed to detect the expression of miR-203 in TNBC cell lines. miR-203 precursor and control microRNA (miRNA) were transfected into triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines and the effects of miR-203 up-regulation on the proliferation and migration of cells were investigated. Meanwhile, the mRNA and protein levels of baculoviral IAP repeat-containing protein 5 (BIRC5) and Lim and SH3 domain protein 1 (LASP1) were measured. Luciferase assays were also performed to validate BIRC5 and LASP1 as miR-203 targets. Both miR-203 and BIRC5 siRNA signicantly inhibited cell proliferation in TNBC cells. Both miR-203 and LASP1 siRNA signicantly inhibited cell migration in TNBC cells, also. Moreover, up-regulated of BIRC5 and LASP1 was able to abrogate the effects induced by transfection with the miR-203 precursor. These data suggest that miR-203 may function as a tumor suppressor in TNBC cells. Thus, miR-203 could be a potential therapeutic target for this disease.

22714950	Title	MicroRNA-181a regulates local immune balance by inhibiting proliferation and immunosuppressive properties of mesenchymal stem cells.
22714950	Abstract	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) exhibit extensive self-renewal potential and can modulate immunocyte activation. Our previous study reported that miR-181a expression was significantly increased in placenta from women with severe preeclampsia (PE), but the mechanisms by which miR-181a regulates MSCs are unknown. In this study, we asked if and how miR-181a regulates MSCs' proliferation and immunosuppressive properties. We found that the expression of miR-181a in the MSCs derived from the umbilical cord and decidua of PE patients increased relative to MSCs derived from normal patients. Transfection with miR-181a oligos prevented MSCs proliferation but did not affect MSCs apoptosis. Overexpression of miR-181a blocked activation of the TGF-Beta signaling pathway and caused downregulation of target gene (TGFBR1 and TGFBRAP1) mRNA and protein expression. Reporter genes with putative miR-181a binding sites from the TGFBR1 and TGFBRAP1 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) were downregulated in the presence of miR-181a, suggesting that miR-181a binds to TGFBR1 and TGFBRAP1 3'-UTRs. In contrast, transfection of MSCs with miR-181a oligo enhanced expression of IL-6 and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase by activating p38 and JNK signaling pathways, respectively. MSCs transfected with miR-181a also enhanced the proliferation of T cells in a short-term culture. Additionally, treatment with control MSCs, but not miR-181a transfected MSCs, improved dextran sulfate sodium-induced experimental colitis, suggesting that miR-181a attenuates the immunosuppressive properties of MSCs in vivo. Together, our data demonstrate that miR-181a is an important endogenous regulator in the proliferation and immunosuppressive properties of MSCs.

22723551	Title	The down-regulation of miR-125b in chronic lymphocytic leukemias leads to metabolic adaptation of cells to a transformed state.
22723551	Abstract	MiR-125b-1 maps at 11q24, a chromosomal region close to the epicenter of 11q23 deletions in chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLLs). Our results establish that both aggressive and indolent CLL patients show reduced expression of miR-125b. Overexpression of miR-125b in CLL-derived cell lines resulted in the repression of many transcripts encoding enzymes implicated in cell metabolism. Metabolomics analyses showed that miR-125b overexpression modulated glucose, glutathione, lipid, and glycerolipid metabolism. Changes on the same metabolic pathways also were observed in CLLs. We furthermore analyzed the expression of some of miR-125b-target transcripts that are potentially involved in the aforementioned metabolic pathways and defined a miR-125b-dependent CLL metabolism-related transcript signature. Thus, miR-125b acts as a master regulator for the adaptation of cell metabolism to a transformed state. MiR-125b and miR-125b-dependent metabolites therefore warrant further investigation as possible novel therapeutic approaches for patients with CLL.

22726614	Title	Integrated analysis of microRNA expression and mRNA transcriptome in lungs of avian influenza virus infected broilers.
22726614	Abstract	Avian influenza virus (AIV) outbreaks are worldwide threats to both poultry and humans. Our previous study suggested microRNAs (miRNAs) play significant roles in the regulation of host response to AIV infection in layer chickens. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis if genetic background play essential role in the miRNA regulation of AIV infection in chickens and if miRNAs that were differentially expressed in layer with AIV infection would be modulated the same way in broiler chickens. Furthermore, by integrating with parallel mRNA expression profiling, potential molecular mechanisms of host response to AIV infection can be further exploited. Total RNA isolated from the lungs of non-infected and low pathogenic H5N3 infected broilers at four days post-infection were used for both miRNA deep sequencing and mRNA microarray analyses. A total of 2.6 M and 3.3 M filtered high quality reads were obtained from infected and non-infected chickens by Solexa GA-I Sequencer, respectively. A total of 271 miRNAs in miRBase 16.0 were identified and one potential novel miRNA was discovered. There were 121 miRNAs differentially expressed at the 5% false discovery rate by Fisher's exact test. More miRNAs were highly expressed in infected lungs (108) than in non-infected lungs (13), which was opposite to the findings in layer chickens. This result suggested that a different regulatory mechanism of host response to AIV infection mediated by miRNAs might exist in broiler chickens. Analysis using the chicken 44 K Agilent microarray indicated that 508 mRNAs (347 down-regulated) were differentially expressed following AIV infection. A comprehensive analysis combining both miRNA and targeted mRNA gene expression suggests that gga-miR-34a, 122-1, 122-2, 146a, 155, 206, 1719, 1594, 1599 and 451, and MX1, IL-8, IRF-7, TNFRS19 are strong candidate miRNAs or genes involved in regulating the host response to AIV infection in the lungs of broiler chickens. Further miRNA or gene specific knock-down assay is warranted to elucidate underlying mechanism of AIV infection regulation in the chicken.

22736314	Title	Identification of microRNA-31 as a novel regulator contributing to impaired interleukin-2 production in T cells from patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
22736314	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) function to fine-tune the control of immune cell signaling. It is well established that there are abnormalities in the interleukin-2 (IL-2)-related signaling pathways in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The miR-31 microRNA has been found to be markedly underexpressed in patients with SLE, and thus the present study was undertaken to investigate the role of miR-31 in IL-2 defects in lupus T cells. Expression levels of miR-31 were quantitated using TaqMan miRNA assays. Transfection and stimulation of cultured cells followed by TaqMan quantitative polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and reporter gene assays were conducted to determine the biologic function of miR-31. NF-AT nuclear translocation and expression were quantitatively measured using an ImageStream cytometer. Bioinformatics analysis, small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown, and Western blotting were performed to validate miR-31 targets and effects. The expression of miR-31 was significantly decreased in lupus T cells, and this was positively correlated with the expression of IL-2. Overexpression of miR-31 in T cells increased the production of IL-2 by altering NF-AT nuclear expression and IL2 promoter activity, while knockdown of endogenous miR-31 reduced IL-2 production. RhoA expression was directly repressed by miR-31 in T cells. Of note, siRNA-mediated knockdown of RhoA enhanced IL2 promoter activity and, consequently, up-regulated IL-2 production. RhoA expression was consistently up-regulated and negatively correlated with the levels of miR-31 in lupus T cells. Manipulation of miR-31 expression in lupus T cells restored the expression of IL-2 at both the messenger RNA and protein levels. MicroRNA-31 is a novel enhancer of IL-2 production during T cell activation. Dysregulation of miR-31 and its target, RhoA, could be a novel molecular mechanism underlying the IL-2 deficiency in patients with SLE.

22745231	Title	A miRNA-regulatory network explains how dysregulated miRNAs perturb oncogenic processes across diverse cancers.
22745231	Abstract	Genes regulated by the same miRNA can be discovered by virtue of their coexpression at the transcriptional level and the presence of a conserved miRNA-binding site in their 3' UTRs. Using this principle we have integrated the three best performing and complementary algorithms into a framework for inference of regulation by miRNAs (FIRM) from sets of coexpressed genes. We demonstrate the utility of FIRM by inferring a cancer-miRNA regulatory network through the analysis of 2240 gene coexpression signatures from 46 cancers. By analyzing this network for functional enrichment of known hallmarks of cancer we have discovered a subset of 13 miRNAs that regulate oncogenic processes across diverse cancers. We have performed experiments to test predictions from this miRNA-regulatory network to demonstrate that miRNAs of the miR-29 family (miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c) regulate specific genes associated with tissue invasion and metastasis in lung adenocarcinoma. Further, we highlight the specificity of using FIRM inferences to identify miRNA-regulated genes by experimentally validating that miR-767-5p, which partially shares the miR-29 seed sequence, regulates only a subset of miR-29 targets. By providing mechanistic linkage between miRNA dysregulation in cancer, their binding sites in the 3'UTRs of specific sets of coexpressed genes, and their associations with known hallmarks of cancer, FIRM, and the inferred cancer miRNA-regulatory network will serve as a powerful public resource for discovery of potential cancer biomarkers.

22750473	Title	MiR-410 regulates MET to influence the proliferation and invasion of glioma.
22750473	Abstract	MET, the receptor for hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGF), has been reported to trigger multiple and sometimes opposing cellular responses in various types of tumor cells. It has been implicated in the regulation of tumor-cell survival, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis. However, the MET regulatory mechanism in glioma is not well known. MicroRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs that play important roles in a variety of biological processes including human cancers. In this study, we used computational and expressional analysis to identify that the 'seed sequence' of miR-410 matched the 3' UTR of the MET mRNA. Besides, the expression of miR-410 was inversely associated with MET in human glioma tissues. Using luciferase and western blot assay, we certified that miR-410 directly targeted MET in glioma cells. While restoring expression of miR-410 led to proliferation inhibition and reduced invasive capability in glioma cells. Furthermore, we showed that miR-410 played an important role in regulating MET-induced AKT signal transduction. While downregulation of MET by RNAi, we observed that MET knockdown resulted in effects similar to that with miR-410 transfection in glioma cells. Our findings suggest that miR-410, a direct regulator of MET, may function as a tumor suppressor in human gliomas.

22752059	Title	Identification of novel molecular targets regulated by tumor suppressive miR-375 induced by histone acetylation in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
22752059	Abstract	The aim of this study was to determine whether histone acetylation regulates tumor suppressive microRNAs (miRNAs) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and to identify genes which are regulated by these miRNAs. We identified a miRNA that was highly upregulated in an ESCC cell line by cyclic hydroxamic acid-containing peptide 31 (CHAP31), one of the histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs), using a miRNA array analysis. miR-375 was strongly upregulated by CHAP31 treatment in an ESCC cell line. The expression levels of the most upregulated miRNA, miR-375 were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR in human ESCC specimens. The tumor suppressive function of miR-375 was revealed by restoration of miR-375 in ESCC cell lines. We performed a microarray analysis to identify target genes of miR-375. The mRNA and protein expression levels of these genes were verified in ESCC clinical specimens. LDHB and AEG-1/MTDH were detected as miR‑375-targeted genes. The restoration of miR-375 suppressed the expression of LDHB and AEG-1/MTDH. The ESCC clinical specimens exhibited a high level of LDHB expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. A loss-of-function assay using a siRNA analysis was performed to examine the oncogenic function of the gene. Knockdown of LDHB by RNAi showed a tumor suppressive function in the ESCC cells. The correlation between gene expression and clinicopathological features was investigated by immunohistochemistry for 94 cases of ESCC. The positive staining of LDHB correlated significantly with lymph node metastasis and tumor stage. It also had a tendency to be associated with a poor prognosis. Our results indicate that HDACIs upregulate miRNAs, at least some of which act as tumor suppressors. LDHB, which is regulated by the tumor suppressive miR-375, may therefore act as an oncogene in ESCC.

22752225	Title	Induction of the transcriptional repressor ZBTB4 in prostate cancer cells by drug-induced targeting of microRNA-17-92/106b-25 clusters.
22752225	Abstract	Androgen-insensitive DU145 and PC3 human prostate cancer cells express high levels of specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4, and treatment of cells with methyl 2-cyano-3,11-dioxo-18Beta-olean-1,12-dien-30-oate (CDODA-Me) inhibited cell growth and downregulated Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 expression. CDODA-Me (15 mg/kg/d) was a potent inhibitor of tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model (PC3 cells) and also decreased expression of Sp transcription factors in tumors. CDODA-Me-mediated downregulation of Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 was due to induction of the transcriptional repressor ZBTB4, which competitively binds and displaces Sp transcription factors from GC-rich sites in Sp1-, Sp3-, Sp4-, and Sp-regulated gene promoters. ZBTB4 levels are relatively low in DU145 and PC3 cells due to suppression by miR paralogs that are members of the miR-17-92 (miR-20a/17-5p) and miR-106b-25 (miR-106b/93) clusters. Examination of publically available prostate cancer patient array data showed an inverse relationship between ZBTB4 and miRs-20a/17-5p/106b/93 expression, and increased ZBTB4 in patients with prostate cancer was a prognostic factor for increased survival. CDODA-Me induces ZBTB4 in prostate cancer cells through disruption of miR-ZBTB4 interactions, and this results in downregulation of pro-oncogenic Sp transcription factors and Sp-regulated genes.

22752226	Title	Genetic variation that predicts platinum sensitivity reveals the role of miR-193b* in chemotherapeutic susceptibility.
22752226	Abstract	Platinum agents are the backbone of cancer chemotherapy. Recently, we identified and replicated the role of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, rs1649942) in predicting platinum sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. Using the CEU samples from the International HapMap Project, we found the same SNP to be a master regulator of multiple gene expression phenotypes, prompting us to investigate whether rs1649942-mediated regulation of miRNAs may in part contribute to variation in platinum sensitivity. To these ends, 60 unrelated HapMap CEU I/II samples were used for our discovery-phase study using high-throughput genome-wide miRNA and gene expression profiling. Examining the relationships among rs1649942, its gene expression targets, genome-wide miRNA expression, and cellular sensitivity to carboplatin and cisplatin, we identified 2 platinum-associated miRNAs (miR-193b* and miR-320) that inhibit the expression of 5 platinum-associated genes (CRIM1, IFIT2, OAS1, KCNMA1, and GRAMD1B). We further replicated the relationship between the expression of miR-193b*, CRIM1, IFIT2, KCNMA1, and GRAMD1B, and platinum sensitivity in a separate HapMap CEU III dataset. We then showed that overexpression of miR-193b* in a randomly selected HapMap cell line results in resistance to both carboplatin and cisplatin. This relationship was also found in 7 ovarian cancer cell lines from NCI60 dataset and confirmed in an OVCAR-3 that overexpression of miR-193b* leads to increased resistance to carboplatin. Our findings highlight a potential mechanism of action for a previously observed genotype-survival outcome association. Further examination of miR-193b* in platinum sensitivity in ovarian cancer is warranted.

22761894	Title	The negative feedback-loop between the oncomir Mir-24-1 and menin modulates the Men1 tumorigenesis by mimicking the "Knudson's second hit".
22761894	Abstract	Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) syndrome is a rare hereditary cancer disorder characterized by tumors of the parathyroids, of the neuroendocrine cells, of the gastro-entero-pancreatic tract, of the anterior pituitary, and by non-endocrine neoplasms and lesions. MEN1 gene, a tumor suppressor gene, encodes menin protein. Loss of heterozygosity at 11q13 is typical of MEN1 tumors, in agreement with the Knudson's two-hit hypothesis. In silico analysis with Target Scan, Miranda and Pictar-Vert softwares for the prediction of miRNA targets indicated miR-24-1 as capable to bind to the 3'UTR of MEN1 mRNA. We investigated this possibility by analysis of miR-24-1 expression profiles in parathyroid adenomatous tissues from MEN1 gene mutation carriers, in their sporadic non-MEN1 counterparts, and in normal parathyroid tissue. Interestingly, the MEN1 tumorigenesis seems to be under the control of a "negative feedback loop" between miR-24-1 and menin protein, that mimics the second hit of Knudson's hypothesis and that could buffer the effect of the stochastic factors that contribute to the onset and progression of this disease. Our data show an alternative way to MEN1 tumorigenesis and, probably, to the "two-hit dogma". The functional significance of this regulatory mechanism in MEN1 tumorigenesis is also the basis for opening future developments of RNA antagomir(s)-based strategies in the in vivo control of tumorigenesis in MEN1 carriers.

It has been proved to play pivotal roles in cellular homeostasis, cell growth and organism development. Moreover, abnormalities of autophagy have been linked to numerous human pathophysiologies. Emerging evidence has linked leucine deprivation induced protein breakdown to autophagy, but the underlying mechanisms controlling autophagic activity in this process are not fully understood. Here, we demonstrate that two members of the miR-17 microRNA family, miR-20a and miR-106b, may participate in regulating leucine deprivation induced autophagy via suppression of ULK1 expression in C2C12 myoblasts. We showed that leucine deprivation downregulated miR-20a and miR-106b expression via suppression of their transcription factor c-Myc. We discovered the essential autophagy gene ULK1 as cellular target of miR-20a and miR-106b. Treatment of C2C12 cells with the miR-20a or miR-106b mimic decreased the endogenous ULK1 protein levels. Dual luciferase reporter assay confirmed that the miRNA binding sequences in the 3' UTR of ULK1 contribute to the modulation of ULK1 expression by miR-20a and miR-106b. Furthermore, inhibition of ULK1 expression by the miR-20a or miR-106b mimic blunted activation of autophagy induced by leucine deprivation, while suppression of endogenous miR-20a or miR-106b by specific antagomir in C2C12 cells showed normal autophagic activity. Altogether, our data demonstrated that miR-20a and miR-106b regulated autophagy induced by leucine deprivation in C2C12 cells via targeting ULK1.

22785227	Title	TGF-Beta conditions intestinal T cells to express increased levels of miR-155, associated with down-regulation of IL-2 and itk mRNA.
22785227	Abstract	Transforming growth factor (TGF)-Beta, is an immunosuppressive cytokine that inhibits T-cell activation. We hypothesized that TGF-Beta mediates its immunoinhibitory effects by modulation of micro RNA (miRNA)-155 (miR-155). Interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon-Gamma are down-regulated by TGF-Beta in activated CD4 peripheral blood T cells and lamina propria T cells (LPT), but miR-155 is upregulated ninefold specifically in LPT. Consequently, this study focuses on the role of TGF-Beta-enhanced miR-155 on LPT immune responses. TGF-Beta induces miR-155 in both freshly isolated and LPT lymphoblasts, whereas other inducible miRNAs are not regulated by TGF-Beta. Using MAMI bioinformatics database, we determined that inducible T-cell kinase (itk) is a functional target of miR-155 that exhibits an inverse mRNA response to that of miR-155. To determine experimentally that miR-155 regulates itk, transfection experiments were performed that demonstrated miR-155 overexpression decreased itk and IL-2 mRNA, whereas antagonism of miR-155 restored both mRNAs in activated cells. These findings describe a TGF-Beta-dependent function for miR-155 in modulating cytokine and T-cell immune responses in the gut.

22792185	Title	Combinatorial action of miRNAs regulates transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing following in vivo PNS injury.
22792185	Abstract	Injury response in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) is characterized by rapid alterations in the genetic program of Schwann cells. However, the epigenetic mechanisms modulating these changes remain elusive. Here we show that sciatic nerve injury in mice induces a cohort of 22 miRNAs, which coordinate Schwann cell differentiation and dedifferentiation through a combinatorial modulation of their positive and negative gene regulators. These miRNAs and their targeted mRNAs form functional complexes with the Argonaute-2 protein to mediate post-transcriptional gene silencing. MiR-138 and miR-709 show the highest affinity amongst the cohort, for binding and regulation of Egr2, Sox-2 and c-Jun expression following injury. Moreover, miR-709 participates in the formation of epigenetic silencing complexes with H3K27me3 and Argonaute-1 to induce transcriptional gene silencing of the Egr2 promoter. Collectively, we identified a discrete cohort of miRNAs as the central epigenetic regulators of the transition between differentiation and dedifferentiation during the acute phase of PNS injury.

22792280	Title	MicroRNA 107 partly inhibits endothelial progenitor cells differentiation via HIF-1Beta.
22792280	Abstract	Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play an important role in tissue repair after ischemic heart disease. In particular, the recovery of endothelial function is reliant on the ability and rate of EPCs differentiate into mature endothelial cells. The present study evaluated the effect of microRNA 107 (miR-107) on the mechanism of EPCs differentiation. EPCs were isolated from rats' bone marrow and miR-107 expression of EPCs in hypoxic and normoxic conditions were measured by real-time qualitative PCR. CD31 was analyzed by flow cytometry and eNOS was examined by real-time qualitative PCR and western blotting and these were used as markers of EPC differentiation. In order to reveal the mechanism, we used miR107 inhibitor and lentiviral vector expressing a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that targets miR-107 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 Beta (HIF-1Beta) to alter miR107 and HIF-1Beta expression. MiR-107 expression were increased in EPCs under hypoxic conditions. Up-regulation of miR-107 partly suppressed the EPCs differentiation induced in hypoxia, while down-regulation of miR-107 promoted EPC differentiation. HIF-1Beta was the target. This study indicated that miR-107 was up-regulated in hypoxia to prevent EPCs differentiation via its target HIF-1Beta. The physiological mechanisms of miR-107 must be evaluated if it is to be used as a potential anti-ischemia therapeutic regime.

22806311	Title	miR-21 induces cell cycle at S phase and modulates cell proliferation by down-regulating hMSH2 in lung cancer.
22806311	Abstract	MicroRNAs regulate critical genes associated with lung cancer. Human mutS homolog 2 (hMSH2), one of the core mismatch repair genes, is affected in lung cancer development. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of miR-21 in hMSH2 gene expression and the effect of miR-21 on cell proliferation and cell cycle in lung cancer. The targets of miR-21 were predicted by a bioinformatics tool, and hMSH2 was validated as a direct target of miR-21 by luciferase activity assay. MiRNA mimics or inhibitors were used to stimulate or attenuate the effect of endogenous miR-21 on hMSH2 expression. MiR-21 and hMSH2 expressions were assessed with real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting. Cell cycle was determined by flow cytometry, and cell growth was analyzed by MTT assay and real-time cell analysis system. MiR-21 expression was inversely correlated with hMSH2 expression in human lung cancer cell lines. Further validation showed hMSH2 was directly regulated by miR-21. The up-regulation of miR-21 significantly promoted cell proliferation and revealed a higher proportion of cells at S phase. However, knockdown of miR-21 expression resulted in cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and inhibited cell proliferation. These data suggest miR-21 is a key regulator of hMSH2 and modulates cell cycle and proliferation by targeting hMSH2 in human lung cancer.

22808276	Title	Synergetic cooperation of microRNAs with transcription factors in iPS cell generation.
22808276	Abstract	Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells were first generated by forced expression of transcription factors (TFs) in fibroblasts. Recently, iPS cells have been generated more rapidly and efficiently using miRNAs with or without other transcription factors. However, the specific and collaborative roles of miRNAs and transcription factors in pluripotency acquisition and maintenance remain to be further investigated. Here, based on the miRNA profiling in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), MEFs infected with Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc (OSKM) for 1, 2, 4, or 8 day, two iPS cell lines and ES cells, representing iPS activation and maintenance steps, we found that two unique miRNA sets are responsible for different steps of iPS generation, and the miRNA expression profiles of iPS cells are very similar to that of ES cells. Furthermore, we searched for transcription factors binding sites at the promoter regions of up-regulated miRNAs, and found that up-regulated miRNAs such as the miR-429-200 and miR-17 clusters are directly activated by exogenous TFs. The GO and pathway enrichment for candidate target gene sets of miRNAs or OSKM provided a clear picture of division and collaboration between miRNAs and OSKM during completion of the iPS process. Compared with the pathways regulated by OSKM, we found that miRNAs play critical roles in regulating iPS-specific pathways, such as the adherens junction and Wnt signaling pathways. Furthermore, we blocked miRNA expression using Dicer knockdown, and found that the level of miRNAs was decreased following this treatment, and the efficiency of iPS generation was significantly repressed. By combining high-throughput analysis, biostatistical analysis and functional experiments, this study provides new ideas for investigating the important roles of miRNAs, the mechanisms of miRNAs and related signaling pathways, and the potential for many more applications of miRNAs in somatic cell reprogramming.

22815788	Title	MicroRNA profiling in mucosal biopsies of eosinophilic esophagitis patients pre and post treatment with steroids and relationship with mRNA targets.
22815788	Abstract	The characterization of miRNAs and their target mRNAs involved in regulation of the immune process is an area of intense research and relatively little is known governing these processes in allergic inflammation. Here we present novel findings defining the miRNA and mRNA transcriptome in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), an increasing recognized allergic disorder. Esophageal epithelial miRNA and mRNA from five paired biopsies pre- and post-treatment with glucocorticosteroids were profiled using Taqman and Affymetrix arrays. Validation was performed on additional paired biopsies, untreated EoE specimens and normal controls. Differentially regulated miRNAs and mRNAs were generated, within which miRNA-mRNA target pairs with high predicted confidence were identified. Compared to the post-glucocorticoid treated esophageal mucosa, of all the 377 miRNA sequences examined, 32 miRNAs were significantly upregulated and four downregulated in the pre-treated biopsies. MiR-214 was the most upregulated (150 fold) and miR-146b-5b, 146a, 145, 142-3p and 21 were upregulated by at least 10 fold. Out of 12 miRNAs chosen for validation by qRT-PCR, five (miR-214, 146b-5p, 146a, 142-3p and 21) were confirmed and 11 shared the same trend. When the expression of the 12 miRNAs in the EoE mucosa was compared to unrelated normal mucosa, six (miR-214, 146b-5p, 146a, 21, 203, and 489) showed similar significant changes as in the paired samples and 10 of them shared the same trend. In the same five pairs of samples used to profile miRNA, 311 mRNAs were down-regulated and 35 were up-regulated in pre-treated EoE mucosa. Among them, 164 mRNAs were identified as potential targets of differentially regulated miRNAs. Further analysis revealed that immune-related genes, targeted and non-targeted by miRNAs, were among the most important genes involved in the pathogenesis of EoE. Our findings add to the accumulating body of data defining a regulatory role for miRNA in immune and allergic processes.

22815988	Title	MicroRNA-122 down-regulation is involved in phenobarbital-mediated activation of the constitutive androstane receptor.
22815988	Abstract	Constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is a nuclear receptor that regulates the transcription of target genes, including CYP2B and 3A. Phenobarbital activates CAR, at least in part, in an AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent manner. However, the precise mechanisms underlying phenobarbital activation of AMPK are still unclear. In the present study, it was demonstrated that phenobarbital administration to mice decreases hepatic miR-122, a liver-enriched microRNA involved in both hepatic differentiation and function. The time-course change in the phenobarbital-mediated down-regulation of miR-122 was inversely correlated with AMPK activation. Phenobarbital decreased primary miR-122 to approximately 25% of the basal level as early as 1 h and suppressed transactivity of mir-122 promoter in HuH-7 cells, suggesting that the down-regulation occurred at the transcriptional level. AMPK activation by metformin or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-Beta-D-ribonucleoside had no evident effect on miR-122 levels. An inhibitory RNA specific for miR-122 increased activated AMPK and CAR-mediated trancactivation of the phenobarbital-responsive enhancer module in HepG2 cells. Conversely, the reporter activity induced by the ectopic CAR was almost completely suppressed by co-transfection with the miR-122 mimic RNA. GFP-tagged CAR was expressed in the cytoplasm in addition to the nucleus in the majority of HuH-7 cells in which miR-122 was highly expressed. Co-transfection of the mimic or the inhibitor RNA for miR-122 further increased or decreased, respectively, the number of cells that expressed GFP-CAR in the cytoplasm. Taken together, these results suggest that phenobarbital-mediated down-regulation of miR-122 is an early and important event in the AMPK-dependent CAR activation and transactivation of its target genes.

22828209	Title	Mechanism of folate deficiency-induced apoptosis in mouse embryonic stem cells: Cell cycle arrest/apoptosis in G1/G0 mediated by microRNA-302a and tumor suppressor gene Lats2.
22828209	Abstract	Deficiencies in maternal diet, such as inadequate intake of folate, can inhibit normal development and lead to developmental defects. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may play a role in mediating the effects of folate deficiency in the growing mammalian embryo, although conclusive evidences to support that possibility are not yet available. The goal of the present study was to investigate whether and how folate deprivation alters the properties of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) in culture. For this purpose, mESCs were cultured in folate-deficient or complete culture medium. The results show that folate-deficient mESCs have a significantly higher rate of apoptosis, accumulate in G0/G1 and fail to proliferate. Expression profiling revealed several miRs and many mRNAs are differently expressed in folate-deficient cells. RT-PCR data confirmed differential expressions of 12 miRNAs in folate-deficient cells. Furthermore, bioinformatics analyses and in vitro studies suggested that miR-302a plays a critical role in mediating the effects of folate on cell proliferation and cell cycle-specific apoptosis by targeting Lats2 gene. Together, these results suggest that the effects of folate deficiency on mammalian development may be mediated by miRNAs that regulate proliferation and/or cell cycle progression in ESCs.

22832245	Title	The imprinted H19 gene regulates human placental trophoblast cell proliferation via encoding miR-675 that targets Nodal Modulator 1 (NOMO1).
22832245	Abstract	Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific syndrome mainly characterized by hypertensive disorder and proteinuria after gestational weeks 20. So far the etiology of preeclampsia remains unclear. We previously reported that preeclamptic placentas exhibited decreased mRNA expression and hypermethylation in promoter region of the paternally imprinted H19 gene compared with normal placentas. H19 has recently been identified to encode the precursor of miR-675, indicating a possible novel functional pathway of the imprinting gene. The aim of the present study was to identify the roles of H19 gene via miR-675 pathway in human trophoblast cells, and to figure out the involvement of this pathway in pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Knockdown of H19 gene or inhibition of miR-675 exhibited similar proliferation-promoting effect in human trophoblastic JEG-3 cells. Target gene prediction in combination with luciferase assay revealed that miR-675 could directly downregulate Nodal Modulator 1 (NOMO1) protein expression by binding to 3'-UTR sequence of NOMO1. Overexpression of NOMO1 in JEG-3 cells could rescue miR-675-surppressed cell proliferation and phosphorylation of Smad2, while Nodal had additive effect with miR-675 in suppression cell proliferation and activation of Smad2. In early-onset preeclamptic placentas, expression levels of H19 gene and miR-675 were appreciably lower, while NOMO1 protein level was higher than those in normal placentas. Taken together, our data suggested that H19 gene could inhibit human trophoblast cell proliferation via encoding miR-675 that targeted NOMO1, and aberrantly lowered expression of H19 in placenta may participate in the excessive proliferation of trophoblast cells observed in early-onset severe preeclampsia by downregulating miR-675 which targets NOMO1 and interferes with Nodal signaling.

22835429	Title	Altered let-7 expression in Myasthenia gravis and let-7c mediated regulation of IL-10 by directly targeting IL-10 in Jurkat cells.
22835429	Abstract	Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a T cell-dependent and B cell-mediated autoimmune disease of neuromuscular junctions and cytokines may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis and perpetuation of MG. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated as fine-tuning regulators controlling diverse biological processes at the level of posttranscriptional repression. Dysregulation of miRNAs has been described in various disease states. In this study, miRNA microarrays identified let-7 family to be decreased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from MG patients compared to the healthy controls. We next demonstrated the differential expression of let-7 family in larger samples by quantitative real-time PCR. Using a combination of bioinformatics and molecular approaches, we confirmed IL-10 as a target for let-7c. IL-10 expression also showed a negative correlation with let-7c expression in PBMCs from MG patients. Further experiments revealed that induced levels of IL-10 were inversely related to let-7c levels. We also showed that let-7c could regulate IL-10 expression in Jurkat cells. In summary, our results suggest that abnormal expression/regulation of microRNAs may contribute to or be indicative of the initiation and progression of MG.

22840297	Title	MIR-210 modulates mitochondrial respiration in placenta with preeclampsia.
22840297	Abstract	Preeclampsia (PE) affects 5-8% of all pregnancies and is associated with significant maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Placental mitochondrial dysfunction has been reported in PE. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression through mRNA degradation and translational repression. MiR-210 has been previously shown to be upregulated in placentas from pregnancies complicated by PE. We hypothesized that placental mitochondrial dysfunction during PE can be mediated by miR-210. Placentas were collected at term from normotensive pregnancies (CTRL) and those complicated by severe PE (n = 6 each) following c-section (no labor). Villous tissue from PE showed significantly increased levels of HIF-1Alpha compared to CTRL with no change in corresponding mRNA expression but with reduced DNA-binding activity. Mitochondrial complex III was significantly decreased in PE along with significantly reduced protein expression in complex I and IV during PE. Among the four miRNAs tested, miR-210 showed significant up regulation in PE and significant downregulation of its target, ISCU mRNA. To understand the role of miR-210 in PE, loss- and gain-of-function studies were performed using primary trophoblasts. Trophoblasts were transfected with miR-210 inhibitor or pre-miR-210 and mitochondrial function was measured using Seahorse Extracellular Flux Analyzer. Cells transfected with pre-miR-210 showed significant reduction in oxygen consumption. In contrast, transfection of trophoblast with AntagomiR-210 was sufficient to prevent the DFO-mediated respiratory deficiency. These data collectively suggest that miR-210 overexpression during PE could be responsible for placental mitochondria dysfunction.

22846038	Title	Distinctive expression patterns and roles of the miRNA393/TIR1 homolog module in regulating flag leaf inclination and primary and crown root growth in rice (Oryza sativa).
22846038	Abstract	• MicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated regulation of auxin signaling components plays a critical role in plant development. miRNA expression and functional diversity contribute to the complexity of regulatory networks of miRNA/target modules. • This study functionally characterizes two members of the rice (Oryza sativa) miR393 family and their target genes, OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 (AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX), the two closest homologs of Arabidopsis TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1 (TIR1). • We found that the miR393 family members possess distinctive expression patterns, with miR393a expressed mainly in the crown and lateral root primordia, as well as the coleoptile tip, and miR393b expressed in the shoot apical meristem. Transgenic plants overexpressing miR393a/b displayed a severe phenotype with hallmarks of altered auxin signaling, mainly including enlarged flag leaf inclination and altered primary and crown root growth. Furthermore, OsAFB2- and OsTIR1-suppressed lines exhibited increased inclination of flag leaves at the booting stage, resembling miR393-overexpressing plants. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays showed that OsTIR1 and OsAFB2 interact with OsIAA1. • Expression diversification of miRNA393 implies the potential role of miRNA regulation during species evolution. The conserved mechanisms of the miR393/target module indicate the fundamental importance of the miR393-mediated regulation of auxin signal transduction in rice.

22851079	Abstract	To investigate the expression of microRNA-183 (miR-183) and Ezrin protein in stage II( gastric cancer (GC). Specimens of stage II( GC and paracancer tissues (5 cm away from the tumor tissues) were collected from 72 patients. Real-time PCR was used to detect the miR-183 expression. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the Ezrin protein expression in the tumor tissue. The associations of miR-183 expression with the clinicopathologic features of stage II( GC and Ezrin expression were analyzed. miR-183 expression was lower in stage II( gastric cancer tissues compared with the paracancer tissues samples(median relative expression, 0.676 vs. 1.000, P<0.05). Low expression of miR-183 was significantly associated with histological differentiation(0.429 vs. 0.907, P<0.05), lymph node metastasis(0.507 vs. 0.908, P<0.05). The survival was shorter in patient with low expression of miR-183(63.0+-4.0) as compared to those with high expression of miR-183(75.2+-3.8)(P<0.05). There was a negative correlation between the expression of miR-183 and Ezrin(r=-0.272, P<0.05). miR-183 is down-regulated in stage II( GC, and associated with the differentiation, metastasis, and prognosis. Ezrin is a potential regulatory protein of miR-183.

22851573	Title	The role of microRNA-146a in the pathogenesis of the diabetic wound-healing impairment: correction with mesenchymal stem cell treatment.
22851573	Abstract	The impairment in diabetic wound healing represents a significant clinical problem. Chronic inflammation is thought to play a central role in the pathogenesis of this impairment. We have previously shown that treatment of diabetic murine wounds with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can improve healing, but the mechanisms are not completely defined. MicroRNA-146a (miR-146a) has been implicated in regulation of the immune and inflammatory responses. We hypothesized that abnormal miRNA-146a expression may contribute to the chronic inflammation. To test this hypothesis, we examined the expression of miRNA-146a and its target genes in diabetic and nondiabetic mice at baseline and after injury. MiR-146a expression was significantly downregulated in diabetic mouse wounds. Decreased miR-146a levels also closely correlated with increased gene expression of its proinflammatory target genes. Furthermore, the correction of the diabetic wound-healing impairment with MSC treatment was associated with a significant increase in the miR-146a expression level and decreased gene expression of its proinflammatory target genes. These results provide the first evidence that decreased expression of miR-146a in diabetic wounds in response to injury may, in part, be responsible for the abnormal inflammatory response seen in diabetic wounds and may contribute to wound-healing impairment.

22855835	Title	Contributions of mRNA abundance, ribosome loading, and post- or peri-translational effects to temporal repression of C. elegans heterochronic miRNA targets.
22855835	Abstract	miRNAs are post-transcriptional regulators of gene activity that reduce protein accumulation from target mRNAs. Elucidating precise molecular effects that animal miRNAs have on target transcripts has proven complex, with varied evidence indicating that miRNA regulation may produce different molecular outcomes in different species, systems, and/or physiological conditions. Here we use high-throughput ribosome profiling to analyze detailed translational parameters for five well-studied targets of miRNAs that regulate C. elegans developmental timing. For two targets of the miRNA lin-4 (lin-14 and lin-28), functional down-regulation was associated with decreases in both overall mRNA abundance and ribosome loading; however, these changes were of substantially smaller magnitude than corresponding changes observed in protein abundance. For three functional targets of the let-7 miRNA family for which down-regulation is critical in temporal progression of the animal (daf-12, hbl-1, and lin-41), we observed only modest changes in mRNA abundance and ribosome loading. lin-41 provides a striking example in that populations of ribosome-protected fragments from this gene remained essentially unchanged during the L3-L4 time interval when lin-41 activity is substantially down-regulated by let-7. Spectra of ribosomal positions were also examined for the five lin-4 and let-7 target mRNAs as a function of developmental time, with no indication of miRNA-induced ribosomal drop-off or significant pauses in translation. These data are consistent with models in which physiological regulation by this set of C. elegans miRNAs derives from combinatorial effects including suppressed recruitment/activation of translational machinery, compromised stability of target messages, and post- or peri-translational effects on lifetimes of polypeptide products.

22858023	Title	MicroRNA-155 inhibits proliferation and migration of human extravillous trophoblast derived HTR-8/SVneo cells via down-regulating cyclin D1.
22858023	Abstract	MiR-155 is known to participate in various cellular processes by targeting gene expression. We previously revealed a link between miR-155 and perturbation of trophoblast invasion and differentiation. This study aimed to investigate the target molecule(s) of miR-155 on the influence on the proliferation and migration of trophoblast cells. Bioinformatics analysis showed that, at the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of cyclin D1, six bases are complementary to the seed region of miR-155. Luciferase assays and cyclin D1 3'UTR transfection assays validated that cyclin D1 3'UTR was the target of miR-155 in HTR-8/SVneo cells. Overexpression of miR-155 in HTR-8/SVneo cells reduced the level of cyclin D1 protein, decreased cell proliferation and invasion, and increased cell number at the G1 stage. Furthermore, the increased expression of miR-155 also regulated the protein levels of kinase inhibitory protein p27 and phosphorylated cytoskeletal protein filamin A. In conclusion, we found that cyclin D1 may be a target of miR-155 in HTR-8/SVneo cells, and demonstrated a negative regulatory role of miR-155 involved in cyclin D1/p27 pathway in proliferation and migration of the cells.

22870278	Title	MicroRNA-34a modulates MDM4 expression via a target site in the open reading frame.
22870278	Abstract	MDM4, also called MDMX or HDMX in humans, is an important negative regulator of the p53 tumor suppressor. MDM4 is overexpressed in about 17% of all cancers and more frequently in some types, such as colon cancer or retinoblastoma. MDM4 is known to be post-translationally regulated by MDM2-mediated ubiquitination to decrease its protein levels in response to genotoxic stress, resulting in accumulation and activation of p53. At the transcriptional level, MDM4 gene regulation has been less clearly understood. We have reported that DNA damage triggers loss of MDM4 mRNA and a concurrent increase in p53 activity. These experiments attempt to determine a mechanism for down-regulation of MDM4 mRNA. Here we report that MDM4 mRNA is a target of hsa-mir-34a (miR-34a). MDM4 mRNA contains a lengthy 3' untranslated region; however, we find that it is a miR-34a site within the open reading frame (ORF) of exon 11 that is responsible for the repression. Overexpression of miR-34a, but not a mutant miR-34a, is sufficient to decrease MDM4 mRNA levels to an extent identical to those of known miR-34a target genes. Likewise, MDM4 protein levels are decreased by miR-34a overexpression. Inhibition of endogenous miR-34a increased expression of miR-34a target genes and MDM4. A portion of MDM4 exon 11 containing this 8mer-A1 miR-34a site fused to a luciferase reporter gene is sufficient to confer responsiveness, being inhibited by additional expression of exogenous mir-34a and activated by inhibition of miR-34a. These data establish a mechanism for the observed DNA damage-induced negative regulation of MDM4 and potentially provide a novel means to manipulate MDM4 expression without introducing DNA damage.

22870299	Title	MicroRNA profiling of Epstein-Barr virus-associated NK/T-cell lymphomas by deep sequencing.
22870299	Abstract	The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an oncogenic human Herpes virus involved in the pathogenesis of nasal NK/T-cell lymphoma. EBV encodes microRNAs (miRNAs) and induces changes in the host cellular miRNA profile. MiRNAs are short non-coding RNAs of about 19-25 nt length that regulate gene expression by post-transcriptional mechanisms and are frequently deregulated in human malignancies including cancer. The microRNA profiles of EBV-positive NK/T-cell lymphoma, non-infected T-cell lymphoma and normal thymus were established by deep sequencing of small RNA libraries. The comparison of the EBV-positive NK/T-cell vs. EBV-negative T-cell lymphoma revealed 15 up- und 16 down-regulated miRNAs. In contrast, the majority of miRNAs was repressed in the lymphomas compared to normal tissue. We also identified 10 novel miRNAs from known precursors and two so far unknown miRNAs. The sequencing results were confirmed for selected miRNAs by quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR). We show that the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1 alpha (IL1A) is a target for miR-142-3p and the oncogenic BCL6 for miR-205. MiR-142-3p is down-regulated in the EBV-positive vs. EBV-negative lymphomas. MiR-205 was undetectable in EBV-negative lymphoma and strongly down-regulated in EBV-positive NK/T-cell lymphoma as compared to thymus. The targets were confirmed by reporter assays and by down-regulation of the proteins by ectopic expression of the cognate miRNAs. Taken together, our findings demonstrate the relevance of deregulated miRNAs for the post-transcriptional gene regulation in nasal NK/T-cell lymphomas.

22875364	Title	One SNP in the 3'-UTR of HMGB1 gene affects the binding of target bta-miR-223 and is involved in mastitis in dairy cattle.
22875364	Abstract	High-mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) gene has a universal sentinel function for nucleic acid-mediated innate immune responses and acts as a pathogenic mediator in the inflammatory disease. In an effort to identify the functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the bovine HMGB1 gene that affects the binding to its target microRNA, first, the expression of HMGB1 mRNA in different genotypes and its candidate bta-miR-223 was investigated. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results showed that the relative expression of HMGB1 mRNA in cows with the genotype GG is significantly higher than those in cows with the genotype AA (P < 0.05). The expression of bta-miR-223 was significantly upregulated by 1.95-fold (P < 0.05) in the bovine mastitis-infected mammary gland tissues compared with that in the healthy tissues. Subsequently, luciferase assay indicated that the HMGB1 expression was directly targeted by bta-miR-223 in human embryo kidney 293 T (HEK 293T) cells. One novel SNP (g. +2776 A > G) in the HMGB1 3'-UTR, altering the binding of HMGB1 and bta-miR-223, was found to be associated with somatic count scores in cows. Taken together, the g. +2776 A > G-GG was an advantageous genotype which can be used as a candidate functional marker for mastitis resistance breeding program.

22883233	Title	IRE1Alpha induces thioredoxin-interacting protein to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and promote programmed cell death under irremediable ER stress.
22883233	Abstract	When unfolded proteins accumulate to irremediably high levels within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), intracellular signaling pathways called the unfolded protein response (UPR) become hyperactivated to cause programmed cell death. We discovered that thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) is a critical node in this "terminal UPR." TXNIP becomes rapidly induced by IRE1Alpha, an ER bifunctional kinase/endoribonuclease (RNase). Hyperactivated IRE1Alpha increases TXNIP mRNA stability by reducing levels of a TXNIP destabilizing microRNA, miR-17. In turn, elevated TXNIP protein activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, causing procaspase-1 cleavage and interleukin 1Beta (IL-1Beta) secretion. Txnip gene deletion reduces pancreatic Beta cell death during ER stress and suppresses diabetes caused by proinsulin misfolding in the Akita mouse. Finally, small molecule IRE1Alpha RNase inhibitors suppress TXNIP production to block IL-1Beta secretion. In summary, the IRE1Alpha-TXNIP pathway is used in the terminal UPR to promote sterile inflammation and programmed cell death and may be targeted to develop effective treatments for cell degenerative diseases.

22891046	Title	Mir-24 regulates junctophilin-2 expression in cardiomyocytes.
22891046	Abstract	Failing cardiomyocytes exhibit decreased efficiency of excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling. The downregulation of junctophilin-2 (JP2), a protein anchoring the sarcoplasmic reticulum to T-tubules, has been identified as a major mechanism underlying the defective E-C coupling. However, the regulatory mechanism of JP2 remains unknown. To determine whether microRNAs regulate JP2 expression. Bioinformatic analysis predicted 2 potential binding sites of miR-24 in the 3'-untranslated regions of JP2 mRNA. Luciferase assays confirmed that miR-24 suppressed JP2 expression by binding to either of these sites. In the aortic stenosis model, miR-24 was upregulated in failing cardiomyocytes. Adenovirus-directed overexpression of miR-24 in cardiomyocytes decreased JP2 expression and reduced Ca(2+) transient amplitude and E-C coupling gain. MiR-24-mediated suppression of JP2 expression provides a novel molecular mechanism for E-C coupling regulation in heart cells and suggests a new target against heart failure.

22894925	Title	Respiratory syncytial virus modifies microRNAs regulating host genes that affect virus replication.
22894925	Abstract	Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes substantial morbidity and life-threatening lower respiratory tract disease in infants, young children and the elderly. Understanding the host response to RSV infection is critical for developing disease-intervention approaches. The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in post-transcriptional regulation of host genes responding to RSV infection is not well understood. In this study, it was shown that RSV infection of a human alveolar epithelial cell line (A549) induced five miRNAs (let-7f, miR-24, miR-337-3p, miR-26b and miR-520a-5p) and repressed two miRNAs (miR-198 and miR-595), and showed that RSV G protein triggered let-7f expression. Luciferase-untranslated region reporters and miRNA mimics and inhibitors validated the predicted targets, which included cell-cycle genes (CCND1, DYRK2 and ELF4), a chemokine gene (CCL7) and the suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 gene (SOCS3). Modulating let-7 family miRNA levels with miRNA mimics and inhibitors affected RSV replication, indicating that RSV modulates host miRNA expression to affect the outcome of the antiviral host response, and this was mediated in part through RSV G protein expression.

22895557	Title	miR-124, miR-137 and miR-340 regulate colorectal cancer growth via inhibition of the Warburg effect.
22895557	Abstract	Colorectal cancer represents one of the most challenging diseases. Increasing evidence indicates that aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is related to pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. Cancer cells reprogram metabolic pathways to sustain higher proliferation rates. Whether mechanisms underlying the role of miRNA in colorectal cancer are involved in metabolic reprogramming and the mechanisms through which miRNAs alter cancer metabolism are as yet unknown. Herein, we show that miR-124, miR-137 and miR-340 are associated with poor prognosis of colorectal cancer. Expression of these miRNAs inhibits the growth of colorectal cancer cells. PKM (pyruvate kinase isozyme) alternative splicing proteins (PTB1/hnRNAPA1/hnRNAPA2), which control the inclusion of exon 9 (PKM1) or exon 10 (PKM2), are targeted by miR-124, miR-137 and miR-340. Consequently, miR-124, miR-137 and miR-340 switch PKM gene expression from PKM2 to PKM1. High ratios of PKM1/PKM2 inhibit the glycolysis rate, but elevate the glucose flux into oxidative phosphorylation. These results demonstrate that miRNAs (miR-124, miR-137 and miR-340) impair colorectal cancer growth by counteracting the Warburg effect due to regulating alternative splicing of the PKM gene.

22898879	Title	Hepatic transforming growth factor beta gives rise to tumor-initiating cells and promotes liver cancer development.
22898879	Abstract	Liver cirrhosis is a predominant risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the mechanism underlying the progression from cirrhosis to HCC remains unclear. Herein we report the concurrent increase of liver progenitor cells (LPCs) and transforming growth factor-Beta (TGF-Beta) in diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced rat hepatocarcinogenesis and cirrhotic livers of HCC patients. Using several experimental approaches, including 2-acetylaminofluorene/partial hepatectomy (2-AAF/PHx) and 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC)-elicited murine liver regeneration, we found that activation of LPCs in the absence of TGF-Beta induction was insufficient to trigger hepatocarcinogenesis. Moreover, a small fraction of LPCs was detected to coexpress tumor initiating cell (T-IC) markers during rat hepatocarcinogenesis and in human HCCs, and TGF-Beta levels were positively correlated with T-IC marker expression, which indicates a role of TGF-Beta in T-IC generation. Rat pluripotent LPC-like WB-F344 cells were exposed to low doses of TGF-Beta for 18 weeks imitating the enhanced TGF-Beta expression in cirrhotic liver. Interestingly, long-term treatment of TGF-Beta on WB-F344 cells impaired their LPC potential but granted them T-IC properties including expression of T-IC markers, increased self-renewal capacity, stronger chemoresistance, and tumorigenicity in NOD-SCID mice. Hyperactivation of Akt but not Notch, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), or mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was detected in TGF-Beta-treated WB-F344 cells. Introduction of the dominant-negative mutant of Akt significantly attenuated T-IC properties of those transformed WB-F344 cells, indicating Akt was required in TGF-Beta-mediated-generation of hepatic T-ICs. We further demonstrate that TGF-Beta-induced Akt activation and LPC transformation was mediated by microRNA-216a-modulated phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) suppression. Hepatoma-initiating cells may derive from hepatic progenitor cells exposed to chronic and constant TGF-Beta stimulation in cirrhotic liver, and pharmaceutical inhibition of microRNA-216a/PTEN/Akt signaling could be a novel strategy for HCC prevention and therapy targeting hepatic T-ICs.

22900969	Title	The tumor suppressive role of miRNA-370 by targeting FoxM1 in acute myeloid leukemia.
22900969	Abstract	Recent evidence has accumulated that MicroRNA (miRNA) dysregulation occurs in the majority of human malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and may contribute to onco-/leukemo-genesis. The expression levels of miR-370 and FoxM1 were assessed in 48 newly diagnosed AML patients, 40 AML patients in 1st complete remission (CR) and 21 healthy controls. Quantitative real-time PCR, western blots, colony formation assay, and Beta-Galactosidase ( SA-Beta-Gal) staining were used to characterize the changes induced by overexpression or inhibition of miR-370 or FoxM1. We found that the down-regulation of miR-370 expression was a frequent event in both leukemia cell lines and primary leukemic cells from patients with de novo AML. Lower levels of miR-370 expression were found in 37 of 48 leukemic samples from AML patients compared to those in bone marrow cells derived from healthy adult individuals. Ectopic expression of miR-370 in HL60 and K562 cells led to cell growth arrest and senescence. In contrast, depletion of miR-370 expression using RNA interference enhanced the proliferation of those leukemic cells. Mechanistically, miR-370 targets the transcription factor FoxM1, a well established oncogenic factor promoting cell cycle progression. Moreover, when HL60 and K562 cells were treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a DNA methylation inhibitor, miR-370 expression was up-regulated, which indicates epigenetic silencing of miR-370 in leukemic cells. Taken together, miR-370 may function as a tumor suppressor by targeting FoxM1, and the epigenetic silence of miR-370 thus leads to derepression of FoxM1 expression and consequently contributes to AML development and progression.

22901205	Title	miR-181b as a potential molecular target for anticancer therapy of gastric neoplasms.
22901205	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in carcinogenesis. The aim of the present study was to explore the effects of miR-181b on gastric cancer. The expression level of miR-181b was quantified by qRT-PCR. MTT, flow cytometry and matrigel invasion assays were used to test proliferation, apoptosis and invasion of miR-181b stable transfected gastric cancer cells. miR-181b was aberrantly overexpressed in gastric cancer cells and primary gastric cancer tissues. Further experiments demonstrated inducible expression of miR-181b by Helicobacter pylori treatment. Cell proliferation, migration and invasion in the gastric cancer cells were significantly increased after miR-181b transfection and apoptotic cells were also increased. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-181b downregulated the protein level of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3). The upregulation of miR-181b may play an important role in the progress of gastric cancer and miR-181b maybe a potential molecular target for anticancer therapeutics of gastric cancer.

22905112	Title	Reduced susceptibility of DNA methyltransferase 1 hypomorphic (Dnmt1N/+) mice to hepatic steatosis upon feeding liquid alcohol diet.
22905112	Abstract	Methylation at C-5 (5-mdC) of CpG base pairs, the most abundant epigenetic modification of DNA, is catalyzed by 3 essential DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b). Aberrations in DNA methylation and Dnmts are linked to different diseases including cancer. However, their role in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) has not been elucidated. Dnmt1 wild type (Dnmt1(+/+)) and hypomorphic (Dnmt1(N/+)) male mice that express reduced level of Dnmt1 were fed Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet containing ethanol for 6 weeks. Control mice were pair-fed calorie-matched alcohol-free liquid diet, and Dnmtase activity, 5-mdC content, gene expression profile and liver histopathology were evaluated. Ethanol feeding caused pronounced decrease in hepatic Dnmtase activity in Dnmt1(+/+) mice due to decrease in Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b protein levels and upregulation of miR-148 and miR-152 that target both Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b. Microarray and qPCR analysis showed that the genes involved in lipid, xenobiotic and glutathione metabolism, mitochondrial function and cell proliferation were dysregulated in the wild type mice fed alcohol. Surprisingly, Dnmt1(N/+) mice were less susceptible to alcoholic steatosis compared to Dnmt1(+/+) mice. Expression of several key genes involved in alcohol (Aldh3b1), lipid (Ppara, Lepr, Vldlr, Agpat9) and xenobiotic (Cyp39a1) metabolism, and oxidative stress (Mt-1, Fmo3) were significantly (P<0.05) altered in Dnmt1(N/+) mice relative to the wild type mice fed alcohol diet. However, CpG islands encompassing the promoter regions of Agpat9, Lepr, Mt1 and Ppara were methylation-free in both genotypes irrespective of the diet, suggesting that promoter methylation does not regulate their expression. Similarly, 5-mdC content of the liver genome, as measured by LC-MS/MS analysis, was not affected by alcohol diet in the wild type or hypomorphic mice. Although feeding alcohol diet reduced Dnmtase activity, the loss of one copy of Dnmt1 protected mice from alcoholic hepatosteatosis by dysregulating genes involved in lipid metabolism and oxidative stress.

22920753	Title	Knock-down of NDRG2 sensitizes cervical cancer Hela cells to cisplatin through suppressing Bcl-2 expression.
22920753	Abstract	NDRG2, a member of N-Myc downstream regulated gene family, plays some roles in cellular stress, cell differentiation and tumor suppression. We have found that NDRG2 expression in cervical cancer Hela cells increases significantly upon stimulation with cisplatin, the most popular chemotherapeutic agent currently used for the treatment of advanced cervical cancer. This interesting phenomenon drove us to evaluate the role of NDRG2 in chemosensitivity of Hela cells. In the present study, RNA interference was employed to down-regulate NDRG2 expression in Hela cells. RT-PCR and Western blot were used to detect expression of NDRG2, Bcl-2 and Bax in cancer cells. Real-time PCR was applied to detect miR-15b and miR-16 expression levels. Drug sensitivity was determined with MTT assay. Cell cloning efficiency was evaluated by Colony-forming assay. Apoptotic cells were detected with annexin V staining and flow cytometry. In vitro drug sensitivity assay revealed that suppression of NDRG2 could sensitize Hela cells to cisplatin. Down-regulation of NDRG2 didn't influence the colony-forming ability but promoted cisplatin-induced apoptosis of Hela cells. Inhibition of NDRG2 in Hela cells was accompanied by decreased Bcl-2 protein level. However, Bcl-2 mRNA level was not changed in Hela cells with down-regulation of NDRG2. Further study indicated that miR-15b and miR-16, two microRNAs targetting Bcl-2, were significantly up-regulated in NDRG2-suppressed Hela cells. These data suggested that down-regulation of NDRG2 could enhance sensitivity of Hela cells to cisplatin through inhibiting Bcl-2 protein expression, which might be mediated by up-regulating miR-15b and miR-16.

22922827	Title	miR-15a and miR-16-1 downregulate CCND1 and induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in osteosarcoma.
22922827	Abstract	Osteosarcoma, the most common primary tumor of the bones, causes many deaths due to its rapid proliferation and drug resistance. Recent studies have shown that cyclin D1 plays a key regulatory role during cell proliferation, and non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) act as crucial modulators of cyclin D1 (CCND1). The aim of the current study was to determine the role of miRNAs in controlling CCND1 expression and inducing cell apoptosis. CCND1 has been found to be a target of miR-15a and miR-16-1 through analysis of complementary sequences between microRNAs and CCND1 mRNA. The upregulation of miR-15a and miR-16-1 in the cell line SOSP-9607 induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Osteosarcoma cells transfected with miR-15a and miR-16-1 show slower proliferation curves. Moreover, the transcription of CCND1 is suppressed by miR-15a and miR-16-1 via direct binding to the CCND1 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). The data presented here demonstrate that the CCND1 contributes to osteosarcoma cell proliferation, suggesting that repression of CCND1 by miR-15a and miR-16-1 could be used for osteosarcoma therapy.

22925886	Title	Non-canonical microRNAs miR-320 and miR-702 promote proliferation in Dgcr8-deficient embryonic stem cells.
22925886	Abstract	MicroRNAs are known to contribute significantly to stem cell phenotype by post-transcriptionally regulating gene expression. Most of our knowledge of microRNAs comes from the study of canonical microRNAs that require two sequential cleavages by the Drosha/Dgcr8 heterodimer and Dicer to generate mature products. In contrast, non-canonical microRNAs bypass the cleavage by the Drosha/Dgcr8 heterodimer within the nucleus but still require cytoplasmic cleavage by Dicer. The function of non-canonical microRNAs in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remains obscure. It has been hypothesized that non-canonical microRNAs have important roles in ESCs based upon the phenotypes of ESC lines that lack these specific classes of microRNAs; Dicer-deficient ESCs lacking both canonical and non-canonical microRNAs have much more severe proliferation defect than Dgcr8-deficient ESCs lacking only canonical microRNAs. Using these cell lines, we identified two non-canonical microRNAs, miR-320 and miR-702, that promote proliferation of Dgcr8-deficient ESCs by releasing them from G1 arrest. This is accomplished by targeting the 3'-untranslated regions of the cell cycle inhibitors p57 and p21 and thereby inhibiting their expression. This is the first report of the crucial role of non-canonical microRNAs in ESCs.

22928040	Title	Genistein suppresses prostate cancer growth through inhibition of oncogenic microRNA-151.
22928040	Abstract	Genistein has been shown to suppress the growth of several cancers through modulation of various pathways. However, the effects of genistein on the regulation of oncogenic microRNA-151 (miR-151) have not been reported. In this study, we investigated whether genistein could alter the expression of oncogenic miR-151 and its target genes that are involved in the progression and metastasis of prostate cancer (PCa). Real-time RT-PCR showed that the expression of miR-151 was higher in PC3 and DU145 cells compared with RWPE-1 cells. Treatment of PC3 and DU145 cells with 25 µM genistein down-regulated the expression of miR-151 compared with vehicle control. Inhibition of miR-151 in PCa cells by genistein significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion. In-silico analysis showed that several genes (CASZ1, IL1RAPL1, SOX17, N4BP1 and ARHGDIA) suggested to have tumor suppressive functions were target genes of miR-151. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that miR-151 directly binds to specific sites on the 3'UTR of target genes. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the mRNA expression levels of the five target genes in PC3 and DU145 were markedly changed with miR-151 mimics and inhibitor. Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank tests revealed that high expression levels of miR-151 had an adverse effect on survival rate. This study suggests that genistein mediated suppression of oncogenic miRNAs can be an important dietary therapeutic strategy for the treatment of PCa.

22932723	Title	Exosome-mediated shuttling of microRNA-29 regulates HIV Tat and morphine-mediated neuronal dysfunction.
22932723	Abstract	Neuronal damage is a hallmark feature of HIV-associated neurological disorders (HANDs). Opiate drug abuse accelerates the incidence and progression of HAND; however, the mechanisms underlying the potentiation of neuropathogenesis by these drugs remain elusive. Opiates such as morphine have been shown to enhance HIV transactivation protein Tat-mediated toxicity in both human neurons and neuroblastoma cells. In the present study, we demonstrate reduced expression of the tropic factor platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-B with a concomitant increase in miR-29b in the basal ganglia region of the brains of morphine-dependent simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques compared with the SIV-infected controls. In vitro relevance of these findings was corroborated in cultures of astrocytes exposed to morphine and HIV Tat that led to increased release of miR-29b in exosomes. Subsequent treatment of neuronal SH-SY5Y cell line with exosomes from treated astrocytes resulted in decreased expression of PDGF-B, with a concomitant decrease in viability of neurons. Furthermore, it was shown that PDGF-B was a target for miR-29b as evidenced by the fact that binding of miR-29 to the 3'-untranslated region of PDGF-B mRNA resulted in its translational repression in SH-SY5Y cells. Understanding the regulation of PDGF-B expression may provide insights into the development of potential therapeutic targets for neuronal loss in HIV-1-infected opiate abusers.

22934698	Title	Oncogenic miR-544 is an important molecular target in gastric cancer.
22934698	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and promoter hypermethylation are vital epigenetic mechanisms for transcriptional inactivation of tumor suppressor. IRX1 is a newly identified tumor suppressor gene and hypermethylation involves the decreased expression in gastric cancer. However, the microRNA regulatory mechanism on IRX1 expression is still unclear. In this study, we report an IRX1-targeting miRNA-544, which directly targets 3'-UTR of IRX1 gene by luciferase reporter assay. miR-544 suppresses the protein expression of IRX1 gene by Western blot and immunocytochemistry. Ectopic expression of miR-544 promotes cell proliferation and cell cycle progression significantly in vitro on gastric cancer cells. The study suggests that miR-544 is an oncogenic microRNA in gastric cancer. Over expression of miR-544 contributes to the inactivation and low-expression of IRX1 in gastric cancer. These findings are helpful for clarifying the molecular mechanisms involved in gastric carcinogenesis and indicate that miR-544 is a key regulator in switching cell cycle on or off. miR-544 may be a potential molecular target in miRNA-based strategy on gastric cancer.

22952654	Title	Identification of novel targets for miR-29a using miRNA proteomics.
22952654	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short regulatory RNA molecules that interfere with the expression of target mRNA by binding to complementary sequences. Currently, the most common method for identification of targets of miRNAs is computational prediction based on free energy change calculations, target site accessibility and conservation. Such algorithms predict hundreds of targets for each miRNA, necessitating tedious experimentation to identify the few functional targets. Here we explore the utility of miRNA-proteomics as an approach to identifying functional miRNA targets. We used Stable Isotope Labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) based proteomics to detect differences in protein expression induced by the over-expression of miR-34a and miR-29a. Over-expression of miR-29a, a miRNA expressed in the brain and in cells of the blood lineage, resulted in the differential expression of a set of proteins. Gene Ontology based classification showed that a significant sub-set of these targets, including Voltage Dependent Anion Channel 1 and 2 (VDAC1 and VDAC2) and ATP synthetase, were mitochondrial proteins involved in apoptosis. Using reporter assays, we established that miR-29a targets the 3' Untranslated Regions (3' UTR) of VDAC1 and VDAC2. However, due to the limited number of proteins identified using this approach and the inability to differentiate between primary and secondary effects we conclude that miRNA-proteomics is of limited utility as a high-throughput alternative for sensitive and unbiased miRNA target identification. However, this approach was valuable for rapid assessment of the impact of the miRNAs on the cellular proteome and its biological role in apoptosis.

22952847	Title	Consensus micro RNAs governing the switch of dormant tumors to the fast-growing angiogenic phenotype.
22952847	Abstract	Tumor dormancy refers to a critical stage in cancer development in which tumor cells remain occult for a prolonged period of time until they eventually progress and become clinically apparent. We previously showed that the switch of dormant tumors to fast-growth is angiogenesis dependent and requires a stable transcriptional reprogramming in tumor cells. Considering microRNAs (miRs) as master regulators of transcriptome, we sought to investigate their role in the control of tumor dormancy. We report here the identification of a consensus set of 19 miRs that govern the phenotypic switch of human dormant breast carcinoma, glioblastoma, osteosarcoma, and liposarcoma tumors to fast-growth. Loss of expression of dormancy-associated miRs (DmiRs, 16/19) was the prevailing regulation pattern correlating with the switch of dormant tumors to fast-growth. The expression pattern of two DmiRs (miR-580 and 190) was confirmed to correlate with disease stage in human glioma specimens. Reconstitution of a single DmiR (miR-580, 588 or 190) led to phenotypic reversal of fast-growing angiogenic tumors towards prolonged tumor dormancy. Of note, 60% of angiogenic glioblastoma and 100% of angiogenic osteosarcoma over-expressing miR190 remained dormant during the entire observation period of ∼ 120 days. Next, the ability of DmiRs to regulate angiogenesis and dormancy-associated genes was evaluated. Transcriptional reprogramming of tumors via DmiR-580, 588 or 190 over-expression resulted in downregulation of pro-angiogenic factors such as TIMP-3, bFGF and TGFalpha. In addition, a G-CSF independent downregulation of Bv8 was found as a common target of all three DmiRs and correlated with decreased tumor recruitment of bone marrow-derived CD11b+ Gr-1+ myeloid cells. In contrast, antiangiogenic and dormancy promoting pathways such as EphA5 and Angiomotin were upregulated in DmiR over-expressing tumors. This work suggests novel means to reverse the malignant tumor phenotype into an asymptomatic dormant state and may provide promising targets for early detection or prevention of cancer.

22952885	Title	Novel direct targets of miR-19a identified in breast cancer cells by a quantitative proteomic approach.
22952885	Abstract	The miR-17-92 cluster encodes 7 miRNAs inside a single polycistronic transcript, and is known as a group of oncogenic miRNAs that contribute to tumorigenesis in several cancers. However, their direct targets remain unclear, and it has been suggested that a single miRNA is capable of reducing the production of hundreds of proteins. The majority of reports on the identification of miRNA targets are based on computational approaches or the detection of altered mRNA levels, despite the fact that most miRNAs are thought to regulate their targets primarily by translational inhibition in higher organisms. In this study, we examined the target profiles of miR-19a, miR-20a and miR-92-1 in MCF-7 breast cancer cells by a quantitative proteomic strategy to identify their direct targets. A total of 123 proteins were significantly increased after the endogenous miR-19a, miR-20a and miR-92-1 were knocked down, and were identified as potential targets by two-dimensional electrophoresis and a mass spectrometric analysis. Among the upregulated proteins, four (PPP2R2A, ARHGAP1, IMPDH1 and NPEPL1) were shown to have miR-19a or miR-20a binding sites on their mRNAs. The luciferase activity of the plasmids with each binding site was observed to decrease, and an increased luciferase activity was observed in the presence of the specific anti-miRNA-LNA. A Western blot analysis showed the expression levels of IMPDH1 and NPEPL1 to increase after treatment with anti-miR-19a, while the expression levels of PPP2R2A and ARHGAP1 did not change. The expression levels of IMPDH1 and NPEPL1 did not significantly change by anti-miR-19a-LNA at the mRNA level. These results suggest that the IMPDH1 and NPEPL1 genes are direct targets of miR-19a in breast cancer, while the exogenous expression of these genes is not associated with the growth suppression of MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, our proteomic approaches were shown to be valuable for identifying direct miRNA targets.

22955854	Title	Clinical significance of miR-144-ZFX axis in disseminated tumour cells in bone marrow in gastric cancer cases.
22955854	Abstract	We previously reported that bone marrow (BM) was a homing site for gastric cancer (GC) cells leading to haematogenous metastases. There has been little study that microRNAs regulated pathways in malignant cells or host cells in BM, and thereby regulated the progression of GC. Both microRNA microarray and gene expression microarray analyses of total RNA from BM were conducted, comparing five early and five advanced GC patients. We focused on miR-144-ZFX axis as a candidate BM regulator of GC progression and validated the origin of the microRNA expression in diverse cell fractions (EpCAM(+)CD45(-), EpCAM(-)CD45(+), and CD14(+)) by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS). Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis validated diminished miR-144 expression in stage IV GC patients with respect to stage I GC patients (t-test, P=0.02), with an inverse correlation to ZFX (ANOVA, P<0.01). Luciferase reporter assays in five GC cell lines indicated their direct binding and validated by western blotting. Pre-miR144 treatment and the resultant repression of ZFX in GC cell lines moderately upregulated their susceptibility to 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy. In MACS-purified BM fractions, the level of miR-144 expression was significantly diminished in disseminated tumour cell fraction (P=0.0005). Diminished miR-144 expression in 93 cases of primary GC indicated poor prognosis. We speculate that disseminated cancer cells could survive in BM when low expression of miR-144 permits upregulation of ZFX. The regulation of the miR-144-ZFX axis in cancer cells has a key role in the indicator of the progression of GC cases.

22960625	Title	A novel reciprocal loop between microRNA-21 and TGFBetaRIII is involved in cardiac fibrosis.
22960625	Abstract	Cardiac fibrosis is characterized by aberrant proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts and exaggerated deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) in the myocardial interstitial, and ultimately impairs cardiac function. It is still controversial whether microRNA-21 (miR-21) participates in the process of cardiac fibrosis. Our previous study confirmed that transforming growth factor beta receptor III (TGFBetaRIII) is a negative regulator of TGF-Beta pathway. Here, we aimed to decipher the relationship between miR-21 and TGFBetaRIII in the pathogenic process of myocardial fibrosis. We found that TGF-Beta1 and miR-21 were up-regulated, whereas TGFBetaRIII was down-regulated in the border zone of mouse hearts in response to myocardial infarction. After transfection of miR-21 into cardiac fibroblasts, TGFBetaRIII expression was markedly reduced and collagen content was increased. And, luciferase results confirmed that TGFBetaRIII was a target of miR-21. It suggests that up-regulation of miR-21 could increase the collagen content and at least in part through inhibiting TGFBetaRIII. Conversely, we also confirmed that overexpression of TGFBetaRIII could inhibit the expression of miR-21 and reduce collagen production in fibroblasts. Further studies showed that overexpression of TGFBetaRIII could also deactivate TGF-Beta1 pathway by decreasing the expression of TGF-Beta1 and phosphorylated-Smad3 (p-Smad3). TGF-Beta1 has been proven as a positive regulator of miR-21. Taken together, we found a novel reciprocal loop between miR-21 and TGFBetaRIII in cardiac fibrosis caused by myocardial infarction in mice, and targeting this pathway could be a new strategy for the prevention and treatment of myocardial remodeling.

22968638	Title	MiR-351 transiently increases during muscle regeneration and promotes progenitor cell proliferation and survival upon differentiation.
22968638	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate many biological processes including muscle development. However, little is known regarding miRNA regulation of muscle regeneration. Murine tibialis anterior muscle was evaluated after cardiotoxin-induced injury and used for global miRNA expression analysis. From day 1 through day 21 following injury, 298 miRNAs were significantly changed at least at one time point, including 86 miRNAs that were altered >10-fold compared with uninjured skeletal muscle. Temporal miRNA expression patterns included inflammation-related miRNAs (miR-223 and -147) that increased immediately after injury; this pattern contrasted to that of mature muscle-specific miRNAs (miR-1, -133a, and -499) that abruptly decreased following injury followed by upregulation in later regenerative events. Another cluster of miRNAs were transiently increased in the early days of muscle regeneration including miR-351, a miRNA that was also transiently expressed during myogenic progenitor cell (MPC) differentiation in vitro. Based on computational predictions, further studies demonstrated that E2f3 was a target of miR-351 in myoblasts. Moreover, knockdown of miR-351 expression inhibited MPC proliferation and promoted apoptosis during MPC differentiation, whereas miR-351 overexpression protected MPC from apoptosis during differentiation. Collectively, these observations suggest that miR-351 is involved in both the maintenance of MPC proliferation and the transition into differentiated myotubes. Thus, a novel, time-dependent sequence of molecular events during muscle regeneration has been identified; miR-351 inhibits E2f3 expression, a key regulator of cell cycle progression and proliferation, and promotes MPC proliferation and protects early differentiating MPC from apoptosis, important events in the hostile tissue environment after acute muscle injury.

22968990	Title	Lycopene inhibits hepatic steatosis via microRNA-21-induced downregulation of fatty acid-binding protein 7 in mice fed a high-fat diet.
22968990	Abstract	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic disorder characterized by hepatic fat accumulation and abnormal lipid metabolism. Here, we investigated the protective effect of lycopene on high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and fatty acid-induced intracellular lipid accumulation by miRNA regulation. C57BL/6J mice were fed high-fat diet with or without 0.05% lycopene for 8 weeks. Hepa 1-6 cells were treated with stearic acid (SA) after 24 h pretreatment with lycopene. Treatment of lycopene improved hepatic steatosis in high-fat-fed mice and reduced intracellular lipid accumulation induced by SA in Hepa 1-6 cells. We demonstrated that miR-21 expression was decreased in livers from high-fat diet-fed mice and Hepa 1-6 cells treated with SA. Lycopene normalized the downregulation of miR-21, which led to the downregulation of fatty acid-binding protein 7 (FABP7), a direct target of miR-21, at both the transcriptional and translational levels. This specific negative regulation of miR-21 was achieved by targeting the FABP7 3'UTR. Upregulation of miR-21 markedly blocked SA-induced intracellular lipid accumulation by blocking FABP7 expression. Moreover, silencing of FABP7 reduced SA-evoked lipid accumulation in Hepa 1-6 cells. The results suggest that lycopene may be a useful functional compound for treating NAFLD by regulating hepatic lipid metabolism.

22971576	Title	Retinoic acid induced 16 enhances tumorigenesis and serves as a novel tumor marker for hepatocellular carcinoma.
22971576	Abstract	Our previous work identified downregulated miR-483-5p in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aims to identify the target of miR-483-5p, evaluate the potential value of this target as a tumor marker for HCC and explore the role of this target in HCC tumorigenesis. Upregulated retinoic acid induced 16 (RAI16) (17/18 cases) was negatively correlated with downregulated miR-483-5p (14/18 cases) in HCC tissues. The dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that RAI16 is a target of miR-483-5p. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed RAI16 was moderate or strong staining in tumor tissues but negative or weak staining in adjacent non-tumor tissues. The sensitivity and speciﬁcity of RAI16 for HCC diagnosis were 70.6 and 93.6%, respectively, and increased to 80.9 and 92.0% when combined with glypican-3. Finally, overexpression or knockdown of RAI16 increased or decreased cell viability and colony formation in HCC cell lines and enhanced or inhibited tumor cell growth in xenograft nude mice. Mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and transforming growth factor-Beta pathways were mostly affected by RAI16. RAI16 could activate the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and SMAD2/3. In conclusion, RAI16 may serve as a useful therapeutic agent for HCC gene therapy and tumor marker for HCC diagnosis.

22972404	Title	Let-7a inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis by targeting EZH2 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.
22972404	Abstract	Let-7a is frequently downregulated in various types of human cancer including nasopharyngeal carcinoma. However, the underlying mechanism of let-7a action in nasopharyngeal carcinoma remains elusive. In this study, we show that the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a direct target of let-7a in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. The inhibition of EZH2 in vitro by let-7a, EZH2 siRNA, attenuated nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell growth, inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. In addition, for each biological process we identified ontology-associated transcripts that significantly correlate with EZH2 expression. Finally, the expression of EZH2 significantly abrogated let-7a-mediated cell proliferation and apoptosis in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. Taken together, our results suggest that let-7a and EZH2 may be potential therapeutic targets for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

22982025	Title	MicroRNA-204 is required for differentiation of human-derived cardiomyocyte progenitor cells.
22982025	Abstract	Human cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (hCMPCs) are cardiac progenitor cells that are unique for their efficient differentiation into beating cardiomyocytes without requiring co-culture with neonatal cardiomyocytes. hCMPCs have shown great potential in preserving the function of infarcted mouse myocardium. MiRNA-204 has been reported to be up-regulated in differentiated hCMPCs, however, its biological significance is unclear. In this study, hCMPC proliferation, viability, apoptosis and necrosis were determined using the ELISA Kit (colorimetric BrdU detection), Cell Counting Kit-8, and Annexin V and propidium iodide staining, respectively. MiRNA-204 inhibition promoted hCMPC proliferation without affecting cell viability and the level of apoptosis and necrosis, indicating that miRNA-204 might be required for hCMPC differentiation. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions were used to detect the expression profile of cardiac genes, including MEF2C, GATA-4, Nkx-2.5, TropT, BetaMHC, and cActin. Cardiac Alpha-actin staining was used to quantify the degree of differentiation. MiRNA-204 inhibition significantly down-regulated TropT, BetaMHC, and cActin and reduced differentiation by 47.81% after 2 weeks of differentiation induction. Interestingly, miRNA-204 mimics (30 nM) did not promote hCMPC proliferation and differentiation. The bioinformatic tool GOmir identified the activating transcription factor 2 (ATF-2) as a potential target, which was confirmed by Western blot and a luciferase reporter assay. ATF-2 overexpression promoted hCMPC proliferation, further demonstrating the role played by ATF-2 as a target gene of miRNA-204. Therefore, miRNA-204 is required for hCMPC differentiation and ATF-2 is a target gene of miRNA-204 in hCMPCs. This study indicates that miRNA-204 is among the regulators that drive hCMPC proliferation and differentiation, and miRNA-204 might be used to influence cell fate.

22982040	Title	TanshinoneIIA ameliorates inflammatory microenvironment of colon cancer cells via repression of microRNA-155.
22982040	Abstract	TanshinoneIIA, an active component derived from a traditional Chinese medicine, has anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effect. However, the mechanisms underlying the interaction between anti-inflammation and anti-cancer of TanshinoneIIA remain elusive. In the present study, a cell model of inflammation between macrophages and colon cancer cells was used. The results showed that TanshinoneIIA inhibited the proliferation of inflammation-related colon cancer cells HCT116 and HT-29 by decreasing the production of inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor Alpha (TNF-Alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6), which generated by macrophage RAW264.7 cell line. We identified Phosphatidylinositol-3, 4, 5-trisphosphate 5-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) was a bona fide target of miR-155. TanshinoneIIA restored the down-regulated level of SHIP1 protein after lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulation in RAW264.7 cells. MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) was up-regulated in macrophages, possibly due to the concomitant increase of PU.1, a transcriptional activator of miR-155, accounting for decreased SHIP1. Treatment with TanshinoneIIA prevented increased PU.1 and hence increased miR-155, whereas aspirin could not. These findings support that the interruption of signal conduction between activated macrophages and colon cancer cells could be considered as a new therapeutic strategy and miR-155 could be a potential target for the prevention of inflammation-related cancer.

22982320	Title	IGF-1 prevents oxidative stress induced-apoptosis in induced pluripotent stem cells which is mediated by microRNA-1.
22982320	Abstract	Oxidative stress contributes to tissue injury and cell death during the development of various diseases. The present study aims at investigating whether oxidative stress triggered by the exposure to hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) can induce apoptosis of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) in a mechanism mediated by insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) and microRNA-1 (miR-1). iPS cells treated with H(2)O(2) showed increases in miR-1 expression, mitochondria dysfunction, cytochrome-c release and apoptosis, Addition of IGF-1 into the iPS cell cultures reduced the H(2)O(2) cytotoxicity. Prediction algorithms showed that 3'-untranslated regions of IGF-1 gene as a target of miR-1. Moreover, miR-1 mimic, but not miR-1 mimic negative control, diminished the protective effect of IGF-1 on H(2)O(2)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, cytochrome-c release and apoptosis in iPS cells. In conclusion, IGF-1 inhibits H(2)O(2)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, cytochrome-c release and apoptosis. IGF-1's effect is, at least partially, regulated by miR-1 in iPS cells.

22982546	Title	E1A expression might be controlled by miR-214 in cells with low adenovirus productivity.
22982546	Abstract	In this study, we explored the differences in the human adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) production efficiencies of various cell types. The rate of virus production was higher in several cell lines, such as HeLa cells, than in Saos-2 cells. The expression level of the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) protein, an adenovirus receptor, was very similar among these cell lines. Although no significant difference in the expression of early region 1A (E1A) mRNA was detected, the amount of E1A protein in the Saos-2 cells was markedly lower than that in HeLa cells. Proteasome inhibitor treatment did not rescue the quantity of E1A in the Saos-2 cells, suggesting that their decreased E1A protein expression is not due to protein decay. To examine the different expression of E1A protein, we employed a bioinformatics approach to identify miRNA that target the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of E1A mRNA and identified miR-214 as a highly promising candidate. In Saos-2 cells, which have abundant levels of endogenous miR-214, the expression of luciferase was dramatically repressed, when the reporter gene was fused with the 3'-UTR of E1A mRNA including an miR-214 binding site. On the other hand, the activity from the same reporter was unchanged in HeLa cells, which display low-level miR-214 expression. Finally, we confirmed that the knockdown of the miR-214 upregulated the productive efficiency of the virus. These findings indicate that cellular miR-214 is capable of inhibiting adenovirus replication by regulating the translation of E1A protein.

22989749	Title	MicroRNA-101 mediates the suppressive effect of laminar shear stress on mTOR expression in vascular endothelial cells.
22989749	Abstract	Shear stress associated with blood flow plays an important role in regulating gene expression and cell function in endothelial cells (ECs). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are highly conserved, small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate the expression of target genes by binding to the mRNA 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) at the posttranscriptional level involved in diverse cellular processes. This study demonstrates that microRNA-101 in response to laminar shear stress (LSS) is involved in the flow regulation of gene expression in ECs. qRT-PCR analysis showed that miR-101 expression was significantly upregulated in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed to 12 dyn/cm(2) laminar shear stress for 12h. We found that transfection of miR-101 significantly decreased the luciferase activity of plasmid reporter containing the 3'UTR of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) gene. Western analysis revealed that the protein level of mTOR was significantly reduced in ECs transfected with miR-101. Furthermore, miR-101 overexpression induced cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition and suppressed endothelial cell proliferation. Finally, transfection of miR-101 inhibitors attenuated the suppressive effects of LSS on mTOR expression, which identified the efficacy of loss-of-function of miR-101 in laminar flow-treated ECs. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that upregulation of miR-101 in response to LSS contributes to the suppressive effects of LSS on mTOR expression and EC proliferation. These studies advance our understanding of the posttranscriptional mechanisms by which shear stress modulates endothelial homeostasis.

22992343	Title	microRNA-146a inhibits G protein-coupled receptor-mediated activation of NF-KappaB by targeting CARD10 and COPS8 in gastric cancer.
22992343	Abstract	Gastric cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related death in the world. Inflammatory signals originating from gastric cancer cells are important for recruiting inflammatory cells and regulation of metastasis of gastric cancer. Several microRNAs (miRNA) have been shown to be involved in development and progression of gastric cancer. miRNA-146a (miR-146a) is a modulator of inflammatory signals, but little is known about its importance in gastric cancer. We therefore wanted to identify targets of miR-146a in gastric cancer and examine its biological roles. The expression of miR-146a was evaluated by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and found up-regulated in the gastrin knockout mice, a mouse model of gastric cancer, and in 73% of investigated human gastric adenocarcinomas. Expression of miR-146a by gastric cancer cells was confirmed by in situ hybridization. Global analysis of changes in mRNA levels after miR-146a transfection identified two transcripts, caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 10 (CARD10) and COP9 signalosome complex subunit 8 (COPS8), as new miR-146a targets. qPCR, Western blotting and luciferase assays confirmed these transcripts as direct miR-146a targets. CARD10 and COPS8 were shown to be part of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) pathway of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation. Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) induces NF-kappaB activation via this pathway and over-expression of miR-146a inhibited LPA-induced NF-kappaB activation, reduced LPA-induced expression of tumor-promoting cytokines and growth factors and inhibited monocyte attraction. miR-146a expression is up-regulated in a majority of gastric cancers where it targets CARD10 and COPS8, inhibiting GPCR-mediated activation of NF-kappaB, thus reducing expression of NF-kappaB-regulated tumor-promoting cytokines and growth factors. By targeting components of several NF-kappaB-activating pathways, miR-146a is a key component in the regulation of NF-kappaB activity.

22995304	Title	TLS-CHOP represses miR-486 expression, inducing upregulation of a metastasis regulator PAI-1 in human myxoid liposarcoma.
22995304	Abstract	Myxoid liposarcomas (MLSs) are characterized by t(12;16)(q13;p11) translocation and expression of TLS-CHOP chimeric oncoprotein. However, the molecular functions of TLS-CHOP have not been fully understood. On the other hand, microRNAs (miRNAs) comprise an abundant class of endogenous small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate the expression of their target genes, and are involved in many biological processes. It is now evident that dysregulation of miRNAs is an important step in the development of many cancers. To our knowledge, however, there have been no reports of the miRNAs involved in MLS tumorigenesis and development. In this study, we have found that miR-486 expression was repressed in TLS-CHOP-expressed NIH3T3 fibroblasts and MLS tissues, and exogenous overexpression of miR-486 repressed growth of MLS cells. Thus, downregulation of miR-486 may be an important process for MLS. In addition, we have identified plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as a novel target gene of miR-486. PAI-1 is a unique type of serine protease inhibitor and is known to be one of the key regulators of tumor invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, knockdown of PAI-1 by a specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited growth of MLS cells, suggesting that increased expression of PAI-1 by miR-486 repression is critical for survival of MLS cells. Collectively, these results suggest a novel essential molecular mechanism that TLS-CHOP activates PAI-1 expression by repression of miR-486 expression in MLS tumorigenesis and development.

22995917	Title	Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling during gastrulation negatively modulates the abundance of microRNAs that regulate proteins required for cell migration and embryo patterning.
22995917	Abstract	FGF signaling plays a pivotal role in regulating cell movements and lineage induction during gastrulation. Here we identify 44 microRNAs that are expressed in the primitive streak region of gastrula stage chicken embryos. We show that the primary effect of FGF signaling on microRNA abundance is to negatively regulate the levels of miR-let-7b, -9, -19b, -107, -130b, and -218. LIN28B inhibits microRNA processing and is positively regulated by FGF signaling. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments show that LIN28B negatively regulates the expression of miR-19b, -130b, and let-7b, whereas negative modulation of miR-9, -107, and -218 appears to be independent of LIN28B function. Predicted mRNA targets of the FGF-regulated microRNAs are over-represented in serine/threonine and tyrosine kinase receptors, including ACVR1, ACVR2B, PDGFRA, TGFBR1, and TGFBR3. Luciferase assays show that these and other candidates are targeted by FGF-regulated microRNAs. PDGFRA, a receptor whose activity is required for cell migration through the primitive streak, is a target of miR-130b and -218 in vivo. These results identify a novel mechanism by which FGF signaling regulates gene expression by negatively modulating microRNA abundance through both LIN28B-dependent and LIN28B-independent pathways.

23001726	Title	The tumor suppressor microRNA-29c is downregulated and restored by celecoxib in human gastric cancer cells.
23001726	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that function as endogenous silencers of target genes and play critical roles during carcinogenesis. The selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor celecoxib has been highlighted as a potential drug for treatment of gastrointestinal tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miRNAs in gastric carcinogenesis and the feasibility of a new therapeutic approach for gastric cancer. miRNA expression profiles were examined in 53 gastric tumors including gastric adenomas (atypical epithelia), early gastric cancers and advanced gastric cancers and in gastric cancer cells treated with celecoxib. miRNA microarray analysis revealed that miR-29c was significantly downregulated in gastric cancer tissues relative to nontumor gastric mucosae. miR-29c was significantly activated by celecoxib in gastric cancer cells. Downregulation of miR-29c was associated with progression of gastric cancer and was more prominent in advanced gastric cancers than in gastric adenomas and early gastric cancer. In addition, expression of the oncogene Mcl-1, a target of miR-29c, was significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues relative to nontumor gastric mucosae. Activation of miR-29c by celecoxib induced suppression of Mcl-1 and apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. These results suggest that downregulation of the tumor suppressor miR-29c plays critical roles in the progression of gastric cancer. Selective COX-2 inhibitors may have clinical promise for the treatment of gastric cancer via restoration of miR-29c.

23011132	Title	The miRNA-212/132 family regulates both cardiac hypertrophy and cardiomyocyte autophagy.
23011132	Abstract	Pathological growth of cardiomyocytes (hypertrophy) is a major determinant for the development of heart failure, one of the leading medical causes of mortality worldwide. Here we show that the microRNA (miRNA)-212/132 family regulates cardiac hypertrophy and autophagy in cardiomyocytes. Hypertrophic stimuli upregulate cardiomyocyte expression of miR-212 and miR-132, which are both necessary and sufficient to drive the hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes. MiR-212/132 null mice are protected from pressure-overload-induced heart failure, whereas cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of the miR-212/132 family leads to pathological cardiac hypertrophy, heart failure and death in mice. Both miR-212 and miR-132 directly target the anti-hypertrophic and pro-autophagic FoxO3 transcription factor and overexpression of these miRNAs leads to hyperactivation of pro-hypertrophic calcineurin/NFAT signalling and an impaired autophagic response upon starvation. Pharmacological inhibition of miR-132 by antagomir injection rescues cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure in mice, offering a possible therapeutic approach for cardiac failure.

23015693	Title	Functional analysis of a crustacean microRNA in host-virus interactions.
23015693	Abstract	Growing evidence from mammals suggests that host microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the antiviral immune response. However, the roles of invertebrate miRNAs in response to virus infection remain to be investigated. Based on our previous studies, the shrimp miR-7 was found to be upregulated in response to white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. In this study, the results showed that shrimp miR-7 could target the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of the WSSV early gene wsv477, implying that miR-7 was involved in viral DNA replication. In insect High Five cells, the synthesized miR-7 significantly decreased the expression level of the fluorescent construct bearing the 3'UTR of wsv477 compared with the expression of the control constructs. When the activity of transfected miR-7 was blocked by locked-nucleic-acid (LNA)-modified anti-miR-7 oligonucleotide (AMO-miR-7), the repression of luciferase gene expression by miR-7 was relieved. In vivo, when the synthesized miR-7 was injected into shrimp, the numbers of WSSV genome copies/mg gills were 1,000-fold lower than those of WSSV only at 72 and 96 h postinfection. The results indicated that the blocking of endogenous miR-7 by AMO-miR-7 led to about a 10-fold increase of WSSV genome copies/mg gills in WSSV-infected shrimp compared with the control WSSV only. Further, it was revealed that the host Dicer1 was an important component for the biogenesis of miR-7, which had a large effect on virus infection. Therefore, our study revealed a novel regulatory function for an invertebrate miRNA in host-virus interactions by targeting the viral early gene.

23017832	Title	MiR-135a promotes growth and invasion of colorectal cancer via metastasis suppressor 1 in vitro.
23017832	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that participate in the spatiotemporal regulation of messenger RNA and protein synthesis. Aberrant miRNA expression leads to developmental abnormalities and diseases. The miR-135a is considered to be oncogenic; however, the functions and mechanisms of miR-135a in colorectal cancer (CRC) are largely unknown. Thus, we investigated the functions and mechanisms of miR-135a, especially its relationship with the metastasis suppressor 1 (MTSS1) gene in CRC. The expression of miR-135a was determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction, while its effect on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion was determined by MTT, without and with matrigel, respectively. The expression of MTSS1 was detected by western blot analysis. It was found that miR-135a expression was higher in human CRC samples than in non-tumor control tissue. Using SW480 and SW620 CRC cell lines, increased proliferation was observed in response to miR-135a. We also demonstrated that miR-135a promoted mobility and invasion via transwell assay with and without Matrigel, respectively, of CRC cells. In contrast, inhibition of miR-135a reduced their proliferative and invasive capability. MTSS1 was identified as a candidate target gene of miR-135a by luciferase report assay. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of MTSS1 was regulated by miR-135a overexpression and knockdown. Similarly, miR-135a-mediated cell mobility and invasion were reduced after MTSS1 was knocked down by small interfering RNA. These data indicated that miR-135a promotes the growth and invasion of CRC cells, at least partially, through targeting MTSS1.

23018031	Title	Dysregulation of miRNA146a versus IRAK1 induces IL-17 persistence in the psoriatic skin lesions.
23018031	Abstract	Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory skin disorder with dysregulation of miRNAs. The expression pattern of miR-146a and target gene IRAK1 in lesions and PBMCs of plaque psoriasis remains unclear. In our study, we found the expression of miR-146a was up-regulated both in lesions and PBMCs of psoriatic patients, and positively correlated with IL-17 expression, whereas the target gene IRAK1 expression was expressed differentially in lesions and peripheral blood. Inability of miR-146a inhibiting target gene IRAK1 may contribute to the persistent inflammation in lesions of psoriasis.

23019226	Title	Loss of SNAIL regulated miR-128-2 on chromosome 3p22.3 targets multiple stem cell factors to promote transformation of mammary epithelial cells.
23019226	Abstract	A discontinuous pattern of LOH at chromosome 3p has been reported in 87% of primary breast cancers. Despite the identification of several tumor suppressor genes in this region, there has yet to be a detailed analysis of noncoding RNAs including miRNAs in this region. In this study, we identified 16 aberrant miRNAs in this region and determined several that are frequently lost or amplified in breast cancer. miR-128-2 was the most commonly deleted miRNA. Embedded in the intron of the ARPP21 gene at chromosome 3p22.3, miR-128-2 was frequently downregulated along with ARPP21 in breast cancer, where it was negatively associated with clinicopathologic characteristics and survival outcome. Forced expression of miR-128 impeded several oncogenic traits of mammary carcinoma cells, whereas depleting miR-128-2 expression was sufficient for oncogenic transformation and stem cell-like behaviors in immortalized nontumorigenic mammary epithelial cells, both in vitro and in vivo. miR-128-2 silencing enabled transforming capacity partly by derepressing a cohort of direct targets (BMI1, CSF1, KLF4, LIN28A, NANOG, and SNAIL), which together acted to stimulate the PI3K/AKT and STAT3 signaling pathways. We also found that miR-128-2 was directly downregulated by SNAIL and repressed by TGF-Beta signaling, adding 2 additional negative feedback loops to this network. In summary, we have identified a novel TGF-Beta/SNAIL/miR-128 axis that provides a new avenue to understand the basis for oncogenic transformation of mammary epithelial cells.

23022383	Title	miR-211 is a prosurvival microRNA that regulates chop expression in a PERK-dependent manner.
23022383	Abstract	MicroRNAs typically function at the level of posttranscriptional gene silencing within the cytoplasm; however, increasing evidence suggests that they may also function in nuclear, Argonaut-containing complexes, to directly repress target gene transcription. We have investigated the role of microRNAs in mediating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. ER stress triggers the activation of three signaling molecules: Ire-1Alpha/Beta, PERK, and ATF6, whose function is to facilitate adaption to the ensuing stress. We demonstrate that PERK induces miR-211, which in turn attenuates stress-dependent expression of the proapoptotic transcription factor chop/gadd153. MiR-211 directly targets the proximal chop/gadd153 promoter, where it increases histone methylation and represses chop expression. Maximal chop accumulation ultimately correlates with miR-211 downregulation. Our data suggest a model in which PERK-dependent miR-211 induction prevents premature chop accumulation and thereby provides a window of opportunity for the cell to re-establish homeostasis prior to apoptotic commitment.

23023935	Title	microRNA-29a suppresses cell proliferation by targeting SPARC in hepatocellular carcinoma.
23023935	Abstract	In the present study, we constructed a lentivirus vector encoding the miR-29a precursor and established two stably infected cell lines, PLC-29a and 97L-29a. The overexpression of miR-29a was confirmed by TaqMan RT-PCR and significantly suppressed the growth of the hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines MHCC-97L and PLC. Dual-luciferase reporter assays indicated that the SPARC mRNA 3'UTR was directly targeted by miR-29a since the mutated 3'UTR was not affected. Silencing SPARC expression by RNAi knockdown resulted in a similar effect as miR-29a overexpression on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell growth regulation. Anti-miR-29a oligonucleotides (AMOs) upregulated the levels of SPARC in the HCC cells. The phosphorylation of AKT/mTOR downstream of SPARC was inhibited in miR-29a-overexpressing HCC cells. We further examined and compared the expression levels of miR-29a in HCC tissues and the corresponding nearby non-cancerous liver tissues of 110 patients with HCC by qRT-PCR, and significantly lower expression of miR-29a was observed in the tissues affected by HCC. Our findings demonstrate that the expression of miR-29a is important in the regulation of the SPARC-AKT pathway and HCC growth.

23024754	Title	ROD1 is a seedless target gene of hypoxia-induced miR-210.
23024754	Abstract	Most metazoan microRNA (miRNA) target sites have perfect pairing to the "seed" sequence, a highly conserved region centering on miRNA nucleotides 2-7. Thus, complementarity to this region is a necessary requirement for target prediction algorithms. However, also non-canonical miRNA binding can confer target regulation. Here, we identified a seedless target of miR-210, a master miRNA of the hypoxic response. We analyzed 20 genes that were inversely correlated to miR-210 expression and did not display any complementarity with miR-210 seed sequence. We validated ROD1 (Regulator of Differentiation 1, also named PTBP3, Polypyrimidine Tract Binding protein 3) as a miR-210 seedless transcript enriched in miR-210-containing RNA-induced silencing complexes. ROD1 was not indirectly targeted by a miR-210-induced miRNA. Conversely, we identified a "centered" miR-210 binding site in ROD1 involving 10 consecutive bases in the central portion of miR-210. Reporter assays showed that miR-210 inhibited ROD1 by the direct binding to this sequence, demonstrating that ROD1 is a bona fide seedless target of miR-210. As expected, both ROD1 mRNA and protein were down-modulated upon hypoxia in a miR-210 dependent manner. ROD1 targeting by miR-210 was biologically significant: the rescue of ROD1 inhibition significantly increased hypoxia-induced cell death. These data highlight the importance of ROD1 regulation by miR-210 for cell homeostasis.

23029264	Title	Upregulation of MircoRNA-370 induces proliferation in human prostate cancer cells by downregulating the transcription factor FOXO1.
23029264	Abstract	Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), a key member of the FOXO family of transcription factors, acts as a tumor suppressor and has been associated with various key cellular functions, including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and angiogenesis. Therefore, it is puzzling why FOXO protein expression is downregulated in cancer cells. MicroRNAs, non-coding 20~22 nucleotide single-stranded RNAs, result in translational repression or degradation and gene silencing of their target genes, and significantly contribute to the regulation of gene expression. In the current study, we report that miR-370 expression was significantly upregulated in five prostate cancer cell lines, compared to normal prostatic epithelial (PrEC) cells. Ectopic expression of miR-370 induced proliferation and increased the anchorage-independent growth and colony formation ability of DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells, while inhibition of miR-370 reduced proliferation, anchorage-independent growth and colony formation ability. Furthermore, upregulation of miR-370 promoted the entry of DU145 and LNCaP prostate cancer cells into the G1/S cell cycle transition, which was associated with downregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, p27(Kip1) and p21(Cip1), and upregulation of the cell-cycle regulator cyclin D1 mRNA. Additionally, we demonstrated that miR-370 can downregulate expression of FOXO1 by directly targeting the FOXO1 3'-untranslated region. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-370 plays an important role in the proliferation of human prostate cancer cells, by directly suppressing the tumor suppressor FOXO1.

23034391	Title	miR-141 as a regulator of the mitochondrial phosphate carrier (Slc25a3) in the type 1 diabetic heart.
23034391	Abstract	Dysfunctional mitochondria are central in the pathogenesis of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Mitochondrial proteomic alterations resulting from diabetes mellitus have been reported although the mechanisms driving changes in proteomic signatures are unknown. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been considered as potential regulators of proteins. The goal of this study was to determine whether miRNAs play a role in diabetes-induced mitochondrial proteomic alterations. Quanitative RT-PCR miRNA screening in diabetic mice, 5 wk following multiple low-dose streptozotocin treatment was associated with alteration in the expression of 29 miRNAs in the diabetic heart compared with control. Among those miRNAs upregulated in the diabetic heart was miR-141 (P < 0.002). miRNA target prediction analyses identified miR-141 as a potential regulator of the inner mitochondrial membrane phosphate transporter, solute carrier family 25 member 3 (Slc25a3), which provides inorganic phosphate to the mitochondrial matrix and is essential for ATP production. With the use of a luciferase reporter construct with a Slc25a3 3'-untranslated region (UTR) target sequence, overexpression of miR-141 downregulated luciferase activity levels confirming miR-141/Slc25a3 3'-UTR binding. miR-141 overexpression in HL-1 cells elicited a decrease in Slc25a3 protein content, ATP production and a decrease in ATP synthase activity, similar to the diabetic phenotype (P < 0.05, for both). Diabetic interfibrillar mitochondria (IFM) displayed decreased Slc25a3 protein content, which was inversely correlated with increased miR-141 expression. Further, diabetic IFM ATP synthase activity was also decreased (P < 0.05). Together these results indicate that miR-141 can regulate Slc25a3 protein expression in the diabetic heart. Further, diabetes-induced miRNA changes may influence mitochondrial proteomes and functional processes such as mitochondrial ATP production.

23055528	Title	Notch3 and Mef2c proteins are mutually antagonistic via Mkp1 protein and miR-1/206 microRNAs in differentiating myoblasts.
23055528	Abstract	Notch3 is expressed in myogenic precursors, but its function is not well known. Notch3 represses the activity of Mef2c and is in turn inhibited by the microRNAs-1 and -206. Notch3 serves as a regulator for preventing premature myogenic differentiation. Understanding how precocious differentiation is prevented is critical for designing therapy for skeletal muscle regeneration. The Notch signaling pathway is a well known regulator of skeletal muscle stem cells known as satellite cells. Loss of Notch1 signaling leads to spontaneous myogenic differentiation. Notch1, normally expressed in satellite cells, is targeted for proteasomal degradation by Numb during differentiation. A homolog of Notch1, Notch3, is also expressed in these cells but is not inhibited by Numb. We find that Notch3 is paradoxically up-regulated during the early stages of differentiation by an enhancer that requires both MyoD and activated Notch1. Notch3 itself strongly inhibits the myogenic transcription factor Mef2c, most likely by increasing the p38 phosphatase Mkp1, which inhibits the Mef2c activator p38 MAP kinase. Active Notch3 decreases differentiation. Mef2c, however, induces microRNAs miR-1 and miR-206, which directly down-regulate Notch3 and allow differentiation to proceed. Thus, the myogenic differentiation-induced microRNAs miR-1 and -206 are important for differentiation at least partly because they turn off Notch3. We suggest that the transient expression of Notch3 early in differentiation generates a temporal lag between myoblast activation by MyoD and terminal differentiation into myotubes directed by Mef2c.

23056458	Title	Spi-1, Fli-1 and Fli-3 (miR-17-92) oncogenes contribute to a single oncogenic network controlling cell proliferation in friend erythroleukemia.
23056458	Abstract	Clonal erythroleukemia developing in susceptible mice infected by Friend virus complex are associated with highly recurrent proviral insertions at one of three loci called Spi-1, Fli-1 or Fli-3, leading to deregulated expression of oncogenic Spi-1 or Fli-1 transcription factors or miR-17-92 miRNA cluster, respectively. Deregulated expression of each of these three oncogenes has been independently shown to contribute to cell proliferation of erythroleukemic clones. Previous studies showed a close relationship between Spi-1 and Fli-1, which belong to the same ETS family, Spi-1 activating fli-1 gene, and both Spi-1 and Fli-1 activating multiple common target genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. In this study, we demonstrated that Spi-1 and Fli-1 are also involved in direct miR-17-92 transcriptional activation through their binding to a conserved ETS binding site in its promoter. Moreover, we demonstrated that physiological re-expression of exogenous miR-17 and miR-20a are able to partially rescue the proliferation loss induced by Fli-1 knock-down and identified HBP1 as a target of these miRNA in erythroleukemic cells. These results establish that three of the most recurrently activated oncogenes in Friend erythroleukemia are actually involved in a same oncogenic network controlling cell proliferation. The putative contribution of a similar ETS-miR-17-92 network module in other normal or pathological proliferative contexts is discussed.

23064117	Title	Expression and regulation of mouse selenoprotein P transcript variants differing in non-coding RNA.
23064117	Abstract	Selenoprotein P (Sepp1), a glycoprotein rich in selenium, is thought to function in selenium transport throughout the body. The sepp1 gene locus potentially produces three alternative transcripts that differ only in their 5' untranslated regions (5'UTRs) and not in their protein coding regions, as indicated by transcript information in genomic databases. Here we investigated the distribution, relative expression, and biological significance of these transcript variants. We confirmed the expression of Sepp1 transcript variants using PCR and sequencing. Using 5'-RACE, we identified multiple 5'-termini upstream from three different splice donor sites, and a single splice acceptor site for exon 2. We found regional and temporal changes in variant expression in select adult and neonate murine tissue and brain regions. Distribution of variants in heart and kidney varied with stage of development. Notably, the Sepp1b variant was localized specifically to the hippocampus in brain. Targeted silencing of individual variants using RNAi demonstrated the biological importance for all transcript variants in cell viability. Additionally, we determined that the Sepp1b variant is a specific target for the miR-7 microRNA by means of its unique 5'UTR structure. Our results emphasize the importance of non-coding transcript variations as a regulatory means for Sepp1 expression in different tissues and stages of development. The presence of a variant localized in the hippocampus and regulated by a microRNA may have implications for the known deficits in synaptic function caused by genetic deletion of Sepp1.

23065816	Title	G-A variant in miR-200c binding site of EFNA1 alters susceptibility to gastric cancer.
23065816	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) post-transcriptionally modulate gene expression by binding to complementary sites at 3'-untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs). Genetic variations in miRNA binding sites may alter individual susceptibilities to many cancers. However, whether miRNA binding site single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) interfere with gastric cancer (GC) susceptibility has not been reported. In this case-control study including 525 GC patients and 501 controls, we selected three miRNA binding site SNPs located in 3'UTRs of genes involved in GC to investigated their associations with GC susceptibility. We identified that rs12904 in ephrin-A1 (EFNA1) gene was significantly associated with risk of GC, with the OR for carrying AG or GG genotype being 0.65 (P = 0.002, OR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50-0.85) compared with AA genotype. Specifically, we found that rs12904 is in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs4072037, a susceptibility variant reported by previous genome-wide association study (GWAS). No significant associations were observed for the other two SNPs (rs699517 in TYMS and rs1042542 in BIRC5). Furthermore, luciferase assays indicated EFNA1 as the target of hsa-miR-200c and rs12904 G > A change resulted in altered regulation of luciferase expression. In addition, rs12904 AA genotype was associated with increased expression of EFNA1 mRNA compared with AG or GG genotype in the cancer tissues from 48 patients. Taken together, these findings indicate that the miR-200c binding site SNP (rs12904 G > A) in the 3'UTR of EFNA1 can modulate EFNA1 expression and is associated with GC susceptibility. Larger replication studies are needed to confirm our findings.

23086751	Title	The microRNA-30 family targets DLL4 to modulate endothelial cell behavior during angiogenesis.
23086751	Abstract	Delta-like 4 (DLL4), a membrane-bound ligand belonging to the Notch signaling family, plays a fundamental role in vascular development and angiogenesis. We identified a conserved microRNA family, miR-30, which targets DLL4. Overexpression of miR-30b in endothelial cells led to increased vessel number and length in an in vitro model of sprouting angiogenesis. Microinjection of miR-30 mimics into zebrafish embryos resulted in suppression of dll4 and subsequent excessive sprouting of intersegmental vessels and reduction in dorsal aorta diameter. Use of a target protector against the miR-30 site within the dll4 3'UTR up-regulated dll4 and synergized with Vegfa signaling knockdown to inhibit angiogenesis. Furthermore, restoration of miR-30b or miR-30c expression during Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) infection attenuated viral induction of DLL4. Together these results demonstrate that the highly conserved molecular targeting of DLL4 by the miR-30 family regulates angiogenesis.

23095762	Title	miR-17-5p targets the p300/CBP-associated factor and modulates androgen receptor transcriptional activity in cultured prostate cancer cells.
23095762	Abstract	Androgen receptor (AR) signalling is critical to the initiation and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). Transcriptional activity of AR involves chromatin recruitment of co-activators, including the p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF). Distinct miRNA expression profiles have been identified in PCa cells during the development and progression of the disease. Whether miRNAs regulate PCAF expression in PCa cells to regulate AR transcriptional activity is still unclear. Expression of PCAF was investigated in several PCa cell lines by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry. The effects of PCAF expression on AR-regulated transcriptional activity and cell growth in PCa cells were determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation, reporter gene construct analysis, and MTS assay. Targeting of PCAF by miR-17-5p was evaluated using the luciferase reporter assay. PCAF was upregulated in several PCa cell lines. Upregulation of PCAF promoted AR transcriptional activation and cell growth in cultured PCa cells. Expression of PCAF in PCa cells was associated with the downregulation of miR-17-5p. Targeting of the 3'-untranslated region of PCAF mRNA by miR-17-5p caused translational suppression and RNA degradation, and, consequently, modulation of AR transcriptional activity in PCa cells. PCAF is upregulated in cultured PCa cells, and upregulation of PCAF is associated with the downregulation of miR-17-5p. Targeting of PCAF by miR-17-5p modulates AR transcriptional activity and cell growth in cultured PCa cells.

23098654	Title	Induction of microRNA-24 by HIF-1 protects against ischemic injury in rat cardiomyocytes.
23098654	Abstract	MicroRNAs are emerging as important regulators of cardiac function. This study investigated the role of microRNA-24 (miR-24) in ischemic cardiomyocytes, based on the observation that miR-24 expression was significantly enhanced in the ischemic myocardium of rats. Using primary cultured rat cardiomyocytes, cell injury was induced by ischemic conditions, and the cells were evaluated for changes in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, cell viability, apoptosis and necrosis. The results showed that miR-24 was increased in myocytes exposed to ischemia. When miR-24 was further overexpressed in ischemic myocytes using the mimic RNA sequence, LDH release was reduced, cell viability was enhanced, and apoptosis and necrosis rates were both decreased. By contrast, a deficiency in miR-24 resulted in the largest LDH release, lowest cell viability and highest apoptosis and necrosis rates in normal and ischemic myocytes, with significant changes compared to that of non-transfected myocytes. Additionally, the mRNA and protein levels of the pro-apoptotic gene, BCL2L11, were down-regulated by miR-24 overexpression and up-regulated by miR-24 deficiency. The luciferase reporter assay confirmed BCL2L11 to be a target of miR-24. Overall, this study showed a protective role for miR-24 against myocardial ischemia by inhibiting BCL2L11, and may represent a potential novel treatment for ischemic heart disease.

23100393	Title	DNA-demethylating and anti-tumor activity of synthetic miR-29b mimics in multiple myeloma.
23100393	Abstract	Aberrant DNA methylation plays a relevant role in multiple myeloma (MM) pathogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that recently emerged as master regulator of gene expression by targeting protein-coding mRNAs. However, miRNAs involvement in the regulation of the epigenetic machinery and their potential use as therapeutics in MM remain to be investigated. Here, we provide evidence that the expression of de novo DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) is deregulated in MM cells. Moreover, we show that miR-29b targets DNMT3A and DNMT3B mRNAs and reduces global DNA methylation in MM cells. In vitro transfection of MM cells with synthetic miR-29b mimics significantly impairs cell cycle progression and also potentiates the growth-inhibitory effects induced by the demethylating agent 5-azacitidine. Most importantly, in vivo intratumor or systemic delivery of synthetic miR-29b mimics, in two clinically relevant murine models of human MM, including the SCID-synth-hu system, induces significant anti-tumor effects. All together, our findings demonstrate that aberrant DNMTs expression is efficiently modulated by tumor suppressive synthetic miR-29b mimics, indicating that methyloma modulation is a novel matter of investigation in miRNA-based therapy of MM.

23100621	Title	Differential expression of select members of the SLC family of genes and regulation of expression by microRNAs in the chicken oviduct.
23100621	Abstract	The yolk and white of eggs from chickens contain proteins and other molecules either secreted or transported by cells of the reproductive tract, or secreted by the liver and transported to the ovarian follicles of laying hens. Nutrients transported by solute carriers (SLCs) include glucose, electrolytes, and amino acids. Although SLC genes have been investigated in mammals, there are few studies of expression of SLC genes in the chicken oviduct. Therefore, we investigated temporal and cell-specific expression of selected SLC genes at 3 h and 20 h postovulation and regulation of their expression by microRNAs (miRs). Expression of SLC1A4 (glutamate and neutral amino acid transporter), SLC13A2 (dicarboxylate transporter), and SLC35B4 (UDP-xylose: UDP-N-acetylglucosamine transporter) mRNAs was limited to glandular epithelium (GE), while SLC4A5 (sodium bicarbonate cotransporter) and SLC7A3 (cationic amino acid transporter) mRNAs were expressed predominantly in the luminal epithelium of the magnum. Interestingly, SLC1A4, SLC4A5, SLC13A2 and SLC35B4 mRNAs were abundant only in GE of the shell gland, whereas SLC7A3 was not detected in the shell gland. In the magnum, SLC7A3 and SLC4A5 were expressed, but SLC1A4, SLC35B4, and SLC13A2 were not expressed at 20 h postovulation. In the shell gland, all SLC mRNAs were expressed at both time points, except for SLC7A3. The miRNA target validation assay revealed that miR-1764 and miR-1700 bind directly to SLC13A2 and SLC35B4 transcripts, respectively, to regulate expression. Results of this study demonstrate cell-specific and temporal changes in expression of selected SLC genes and regulation of SLC13A2 and SLC35B4 expression by miRs in the oviduct of laying hens.

23103763	Title	Reciprocal expression of MRTF-A and myocardin is crucial for pathological vascular remodelling in mice.
23103763	Abstract	Myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF)-A is a Rho signalling-responsive co-activator of serum response factor (SRF). Here, we show that induction of MRTF-A expression is key to pathological vascular remodelling. MRTF-A expression was significantly higher in the wire-injured femoral arteries of wild-type mice and in the atherosclerotic aortic tissues of ApoE(-/-) mice than in healthy control tissues, whereas myocardin expression was significantly lower. Both neointima formation in wire-injured femoral arteries in MRTF-A knockout (Mkl1(-/-)) mice and atherosclerotic lesions in Mkl1(-/-); ApoE(-/-) mice were significantly attenuated. Expression of vinculin, matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP-9) and integrin Beta1, three SRF targets and key regulators of cell migration, in injured arteries was significantly weaker in Mkl1(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice. In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), knocking down MRTF-A reduced expression of these genes and significantly impaired cell migration. Underlying the increased MRTF-A expression in dedifferentiated VSMCs was the downregulation of microRNA-1. Moreover, the MRTF-A inhibitor CCG1423 significantly reduced neointima formation following wire injury in mice. MRTF-A could thus be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of vascular diseases.

23105110	Title	MicroRNAs in the imprinted DLK1-DIO3 region repress the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by targeting the TWIST1 protein signaling network.
23105110	Abstract	Development of metastatic disease accounts for the vast majority of cancer-related deaths. Nevertheless, few treatments exist that are designed to specifically inhibit processes that drive tumor metastasis. The imprinted DLK1-DIO3 region contains tumor-suppressing miRNAs, but their identity and function remain indeterminate. In this study we identify seven miRNAs in the imprinted DLK1-DIO3 region that function cooperatively to repress the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, a critical step that drives tumor metastasis, as well as proliferation of carcinoma cells. These seven miRNAs (miRs 300, 382, 494, 495, 539, 543, and 544) repress a signaling network comprising TWIST1, BMI1, ZEB1/2, and miR-200 family miRNAs and silencing of the cluster, which occurs via hypermethylation of upstream CpG islands in human ductal carcinomas, confers morphological, molecular, and function changes consistent with an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-544 independently inhibited proliferation of numerous tumor cell lines by inducing the ATM cell cycle checkpoint pathway. These results establish the DLKI-DIO3 miRNA cluster as a critical checkpoint regulating tumor growth and metastasis and implicate epigenetic modification of the cluster in driving tumor progression. These results also suggest that promoter methylation status and miRNA expression levels represent new diagnostic tools and therapeutic targets to predict and inhibit, respectively, tumor metastasis in carcinoma patients.

23115635	Title	Regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling and erlotinib sensitivity in head and neck cancer cells by miR-7.
23115635	Abstract	Elevated expression and activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway is associated with development, progression and treatment resistance of head and neck cancer (HNC). Several studies have demonstrated that microRNA-7 (miR-7) regulates EGFR expression and Akt activity in a range of cancer cell types via its specific interaction with the EGFR mRNA 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). In the present study, we found that miR-7 regulated EGFR expression and Akt activity in HNC cell lines, and that this was associated with reduced growth in vitro and in vivo of cells (HN5) that were sensitive to the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) erlotinib (Tarceva). miR-7 acted synergistically with erlotinib to inhibit growth of erlotinib-resistant FaDu cells, an effect associated with increased inhibition of Akt activity. Microarray analysis of HN5 and FaDu cell lines transfected with miR-7 identified a common set of downregulated miR-7 target genes, providing insight into the tumor suppressor function of miR-7. Furthermore, we identified several target miR-7 mRNAs with a putative role in the sensitization of FaDu cells to erlotinib. Together, these data support the coordinate regulation of Akt signaling by miR-7 in HNC cells and suggest the therapeutic potential of miR-7 alone or in combination with EGFR TKIs in this disease.

23125021	Title	miR-10b*, a master inhibitor of the cell cycle, is down-regulated in human breast tumours.
23125021	Abstract	Deregulated proliferation is a hallmark of cancer cells. Here, we show that microRNA-10b* is a master regulator of breast cancer cell proliferation and is downregulated in tumoural samples versus matched peritumoural counterparts. Two canonical CpG islands (5 kb) upstream from the precursor sequence are hypermethylated in the analysed breast cancer tissues. Ectopic delivery of synthetic microRNA-10b* in breast cancer cell lines or into xenograft mouse breast tumours inhibits cell proliferation and impairs tumour growth in vivo, respectively. We identified and validated in vitro and in vivo three novel target mRNAs of miR-10b* (BUB1, PLK1 and CCNA2), which play a remarkable role in cell cycle regulation and whose high expression in breast cancer patients is associated with reduced disease-free survival, relapse-free survival and metastasis-free survival when compared to patients with low expression. This also suggests that restoration of microRNA-10b* expression might have therapeutic promise.

23132244	Title	miR-1 and miR-206 regulate angiogenesis by modulating VegfA expression in zebrafish.
23132244	Abstract	Cellular communication across tissues is an essential process during embryonic development. Secreted factors with potent morphogenetic activity are key elements of this cross-talk, and precise regulation of their expression is required to elicit appropriate physiological responses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are versatile post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression. However, the large number of putative targets for each miRNA hinders the identification of physiologically relevant miRNA-target interactions. Here we show that miR-1 and miR-206 negatively regulate angiogenesis during zebrafish development. Using target protectors, our results indicate that miR-1/206 directly regulate the levels of Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VegfA) in muscle, controlling the strength of angiogenic signaling to the endothelium. Conversely, reducing the levels of VegfAa, but not VegfAb, rescued the increase in angiogenesis observed when miR-1/206 were knocked down. These findings uncover a novel function for miR-1/206 in the control of developmental angiogenesis through the regulation of VegfA, and identify a key role for miRNAs as regulators of cross-tissue signaling.

23135998	Title	MicroRNA-7-regulated TLR9 signaling-enhanced growth and metastatic potential of human lung cancer cells by altering the phosphoinositide-3-kinase, regulatory subunit 3/Akt pathway.
23135998	Abstract	Recent evidence shows that microRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to the biological effects of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling on various cells. Our previous data showed that TLR9 signaling could enhance the growth and metastatic potential of human lung cancer cells. However, the potential role of miRNAs in the effects of TLR9 signaling on tumor biology remains unknown. In this paper, we first report that TLR9 signaling could reduce intrinsic miR-7 expression in human lung cancer cells. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-7 can significantly inhibit TLR9 signaling-enhanced growth and metastatic potential of lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Notably, we identify phosphoinositide-3-kinase, regulatory subunit 3 (PIK3R3) as a novel target molecule of miR-7 in lung cancer cells by Western blotting and luciferase report assay. Further study shows that miR-7 inhibits the effects of TLR9 signaling on lung cancer cells through regulation of the PIK3R3/Akt pathway. These data suggest that miR-7 could act as a fine-tuner in regulating the biological effects of TLR9 signaling on human lung cancer cells, which might be helpful to the understanding of the potential role of miRNAs in TLR signaling effects on tumor biology.

23139829	Title	Reduction of type IV collagen by upregulated miR-29 in normal elderly mouse and klotho-deficient, senescence-model mouse.
23139829	Abstract	MicroRNA (miRNA), a small non-coding RNA that functions as a mediator in gene silencing, plays important roles in gene regulation in various vital functions and activities. Here we show that the miR-29 members are upregulated in klotho-deficient [klotho(-/-)] mice, a senescence-model animal, and also in normal elderly ICR mice relative to wild-type littermates and young ICR mice. In addition, levels of type IV collagen, a major component of basement membranes and a putative target of miR-29, were lower in klotho(-/-) and elderly ICR mice than in wild-type littermates and young ICR mice. RNA degradation mediated by miR-29 may participate in the suppression of type IV collagen, both in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our current findings suggest that the miR-29 upregulated in aging may be involved in the downregulation of type IV collagen, leading to a possible weakening of the basal membrane in senescent tissues, and miR-29 may be a useful molecular marker of senescence.

23142051	Title	Convergent multi-miRNA targeting of ApoE drives LRP1/LRP8-dependent melanoma metastasis and angiogenesis.
23142051	Abstract	Through in vivo selection of human cancer cell populations, we uncover a convergent and cooperative miRNA network that drives melanoma metastasis. We identify miR-1908, miR-199a-5p, and miR-199a-3p as endogenous promoters of metastatic invasion, angiogenesis, and colonization in melanoma. These miRNAs convergently target apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and the heat shock factor DNAJA4. Cancer-secreted ApoE suppresses invasion and metastatic endothelial recruitment (MER) by engaging melanoma cell LRP1 and endothelial cell LRP8 receptors, respectively, while DNAJA4 promotes ApoE expression. Expression levels of these miRNAs and ApoE correlate with human metastatic progression outcomes. Treatment of cells with locked nucleic acids (LNAs) targeting these miRNAs inhibits metastasis to multiple organs, and therapeutic delivery of these LNAs strongly suppresses melanoma metastasis. We thus identify miRNAs with dual cell-intrinsic/cell-extrinsic roles in cancer, reveal convergent cooperativity in a metastatic miRNA network, identify ApoE as an anti-angiogenic and metastasis-suppressive factor, and uncover multiple prognostic miRNAs with synergistic combinatorial therapeutic potential in melanoma.

23142521	Title	Attenuation of miR-126 activity expands HSC in vivo without exhaustion.
23142521	Abstract	Lifelong blood cell production is governed through the poorly understood integration of cell-intrinsic and -extrinsic control of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) quiescence and activation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) coordinately regulate multiple targets within signaling networks, making them attractive candidate HSC regulators. We report that miR-126, a miRNA expressed in HSC and early progenitors, plays a pivotal role in restraining cell-cycle progression of HSC in vitro and in vivo. miR-126 knockdown by using lentiviral sponges increased HSC proliferation without inducing exhaustion, resulting in expansion of mouse and human long-term repopulating HSC. Conversely, enforced miR-126 expression impaired cell-cycle entry, leading to progressively reduced hematopoietic contribution. In HSC/early progenitors, miR-126 regulates multiple targets within the PI3K/AKT/GSK3Beta pathway, attenuating signal transduction in response to extrinsic signals. These data establish that miR-126 sets a threshold for HSC activation and thus governs HSC pool size, demonstrating the importance of miRNA in the control of HSC function.

23143395	Title	YAP mediates crosstalk between the Hippo and PI(3)K-TOR pathways by suppressing PTEN via miR-29.
23143395	Abstract	Organ development is a complex process governed by the interplay of several signalling pathways that have critical functions in the regulation of cell growth and proliferation. Over the past years, the Hippo pathway has emerged as a key regulator of organ size. Perturbation of this pathway has been shown to play important roles in tumorigenesis. YAP, the main downstream target of the mammalian Hippo pathway, promotes organ growth, yet the underlying molecular mechanism of this regulation remains unclear. Here we provide evidence that YAP activates the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a major regulator of cell growth. We have identified the tumour suppressor PTEN, an upstream negative regulator of mTOR, as a critical mediator of YAP in mTOR regulation. We demonstrate that YAP downregulates PTEN by inducing miR-29 to inhibit PTEN translation. Last, we show that PI(3)K-mTOR is a pathway modulated by YAP to regulate cell size, tissue growth and hyperplasia. Our studies reveal a functional link between Hippo and PI(3)K-mTOR, providing a molecular basis for the coordination of these two pathways in organ size regulation.

23143398	Title	MyomiR-133 regulates brown fat differentiation through Prdm16.
23143398	Abstract	Brown adipose tissue (BAT) uses the chemical energy of lipids and glucose to produce heat, a function that can be induced by cold exposure or diet. A key regulator of BAT is the gene encoding PR domain containing 16 (Prdm16), whose expression can drive differentiation of myogenic and white fat precursors to brown adipocytes. Here we show that after cold exposure, the muscle-enriched miRNA-133 is markedly downregulated in BAT and subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SAT) as a result of decreased expression of its transcriptional regulator Mef2. miR-133 directly targets and negatively regulates PRDM16, and inhibition of miR-133 or Mef2 promotes differentiation of precursors from BAT and SAT to mature brown adipocytes, thereby leading to increased mitochondrial activity. Forced expression of miR-133 in brown adipogenic conditions prevents the differentiation to brown adipocytes in both BAT and SAT precursors. Our results point to Mef2 and miR-133 as central upstream regulators of Prdm16 and hence of brown adipogenesis in response to cold exposure in BAT and SAT.

23144691	Title	MicroRNA-149 inhibits proliferation and cell cycle progression through the targeting of ZBTB2 in human gastric cancer.
23144691	Abstract	An increasing body of evidence indicates that miR-149 can both suppress and promote tumor growth depending on the tumor type. However, the role of miR-149 in the progression of gastric cancer (GC) remains unknown. Here we report that miR-149 is a tumor suppressor in human gastric cancer. miR-149 expression is decreased in GC cell lines and clinical specimens in comparison to normal gastric epithelial cell and tissues, respectively. The expression levels of miR-149 also correlate with the differentiation degree of GC cells and tissues. Moreover, ectopic expression of miR-149 in gastric cancer cells inhibits proliferation and cell cycle progression by down-regulating ZBTB2, a potent repressor of the ARF-HDM2-p53-p21 pathway, with a potential binding site for miR-149 in its mRNA's 3'UTR. It is also found that ZBTB2 expression increases in GC cells and tissues compared to normal gastric epithelial cell and tissues, respectively. Silencing of ZBTB2 leads to suppression of cell growth and cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase, indicating that ZBTB2 may act as an oncogene in GC. Furthermore, transfection of miR-149 mimics into gastric cancer cells induces down-regulation of ZBTB2 and HDM2, and up-regulation of ARF, p53, and p21 compared to the controls. In summary, our data suggest that miR-149 functions as a tumor suppressor in human gastric cancer by, at least partially through, targeting ZBTB2.

23144891	Title	A systematic screen reveals MicroRNA clusters that significantly regulate four major signaling pathways.
23144891	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are encoded in the genome as individual miRNA genes or as gene clusters transcribed as polycistronic units. About 50% of all miRNAs are estimated to be co-expressed with neighboring miRNAs. Recent studies have begun to illuminate the importance of the clustering of miRNAs from an evolutionary, as well as a functional standpoint. Many miRNA clusters coordinately regulate multiple members of cellular signaling pathways or protein interaction networks. This cooperative method of targeting could produce effects on an overall process that are much more dramatic than the smaller effects often associated with regulation by an individual miRNA. In this study, we screened 366 human miRNA minigenes to determine their effects on the major signaling pathways culminating in AP-1, NF-KappaB, c-Myc, or p53 transcriptional activity. By stratifying these data into miRNA clusters, this systematic screen provides experimental evidence for the combined effects of clustered miRNAs on these signaling pathways. We also verify p53 as a direct target of miR-200a. This study is the first to provide a panoramic view of miRNA clusters' effects on cellular pathways.

23144934	Title	Micro-RNA30c negatively regulates REDD1 expression in human hematopoietic and osteoblast cells after gamma-irradiation.
23144934	Abstract	We recently demonstrated that a novel cell stress response gene REDD1 protects human fetal osteoblast cell line (hFOB) cells from Gamma-radiation-induced premature senescence. Here we show that levels of endogenous REDD1 are very low in human hematopoietic progenitor CD34+ cells regardless of radiation, but highly expressed in differentiated hematopoietic cells (14 day cultured CD34+ cells) in response to radiation, which might be associated with radiation tolerance of the latter cells. To further understand the mechanisms of radiation-induced damage in different cells, microRNA (miRNA)-arrays were performed using purified miRNAs from CD34+ and hFOB cells before and post-irradiation and real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR was used to validate the expression profiles of miRNAs in the radiation-damaged cells. The results indicate that Gamma-radiation downregulated 16 miRNAs in CD34+ cells and 14 in hFOB cells. Radiation-induced upregulation was observed for 15 miRNAs in CD34+ cells and 18 miRNAs in hFOB cells. The profiles of radiation-induced miRNA expression were completely different in CD34+ vs. hFOB cells. Radiation up-regulated miRNA (miR)-30b, miR-30c and miR-30d in CD34+ cells, whereas it inhibited miR-30c expression in hFOB cells. Since miR-30 has potential target sites located in the 3'untranslated region (UTR) of the REDD1 gene and radiation regulated miR-30c expression in both CD34+ and hFOB cells, we further explored the effects of miR-30c on REDD1 expression using miR-30c inhibitor and precursor (pre-miR-30c). The results show that pre-miR-30c transfection suppressed REDD1 expression in 14 day cultured CD34+ cells and hFOB cells and resulted in hFOB cell death. In contrast, inhibition of miR-30c expression significantly enhanced clonogenicity in CD34+ cells. Our data suggest that CD34+ and hFOB cells have different miRNA expression patterns after irradiation and miR-30c plays a key role in radiation-induced cell damage which might be through regulation of REDD1 expression.

23145039	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding RNA molecules that are often found at chromosomal breakpoints and play a vital role in human cancer. Our previous study found that miR-550a, a frequently amplified miRNA on 7p14.3, was upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the possible functions and molecular mechanisms of miR-550a in HCC remain unknown. In this study, gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays revealed that miR-550a markedly promoted HCC cell migration and invasion. In addition, we discovered that cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 4 (CPEB4) was a potential target of miR-550a in HCC. Further analyses showed that knockdown of CPEB4 expression significantly facilitated HCC cell migration and invasion, which phenocopied the effects of miR-550a on HCC cells. Moreover, a decrease in CPEB4 expression mediated miR-550a-induced liver cancer cell migration and invasion. Interestingly, CPEB4 is frequently downregulated in HCC, and its expression levels correlate with the overall survival of HCC patients. Together, these results suggested that this newly identified miR-550a-CPEB4 axis may be involved in HCC cell metastasis. Moreover, the expression levels of CPEB4 could be used to predict outcomes in HCC patients. Our findings provide novel potential targets for HCC therapy and prognosis.

23146892	Title	Reactive oxygen species regulate ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression via miR-199a/125b and DNA methylation.
23146892	Abstract	Overexpression of ERBB2 or ERBB3 is associated with cancer development and poor prognosis. In this study, we show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) induce both ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression in vitro and in vivo. We also identify that miR-199a and miR-125b target ERBB2 and/or ERBB3 in ovarian cancer cells, and demonstrate that ROS inhibit miR-199a and miR-125b expression through increasing the promoter methylation of the miR-199a and miR-125b genes by DNA methyltransferase 1. These findings reveal that ERBB2 and ERBB3 expression is regulated by ROS via miR-199a and miR-125b downregulation and DNA hypermethylation.

23152059	Title	miR-204 targets Bcl-2 expression and enhances responsiveness of gastric cancer.
23152059	Abstract	Micro RNAs (miRs) are small non-coding RNAs aberrantly expressed in human tumors. Here, we aim to identify miRs whose deregulated expression leads to the activation of oncogenic pathways in human gastric cancers (GCs). Thirty nine out of 123 tumoral and matched uninvolved peritumoral gastric specimens from three independent European subsets of patients were analyzed for the expression of 851 human miRs using Agilent Platform. The remaining 84 samples were used to validate miRs differentially expressed between tumoral and matched peritumoral specimens by qPCR. miR-204 falls into a group of eight miRs differentially expressed between tumoral and peritumoral samples. Downregulation of miR-204 has prognostic value and correlates with increased staining of Bcl-2 protein in tumoral specimens. Ectopic expression of miR-204 inhibited colony forming ability, migration and tumor engraftment of GC cells. miR-204 targeted Bcl-2 messenger RNA and increased responsiveness of GC cells to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin treatment. Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 protein counteracted miR-204 pro-apoptotic activity in response to 5-fluorouracil. Altogether, these findings suggest that modulation of aberrant expression of miR-204, which in turn releases oncogenic Bcl-2 protein activity might hold promise for preventive and therapeutic strategies of GC.

23152062	Title	Molecular targeting of NOX4 for neuropathic pain after traumatic injury of the spinal cord.
23152062	Abstract	Neuropathic pain is a well-known type of chronic pain caused by damage to the nervous system. Until recently, many researchers have primarily focused on identifying cellular or chemical sources of neuropathic pain or have approached neuropathic pain via the basis of biological study. We investigated whether both mmu-mir-23b (miR23b) and NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4) antibody infusion can alleviate neuropathic pain by compensating for abnormally downregulated miR23b via reducing the expression of its target gene, NOX4, a reactive oxygen species (ROS) family member overexpressed in neuropathic pain. Ectopic miR23b expression effectively downregulated NOX4 and finally normalized glutamic acid decarboxylase 65/67 expression. Moreover, animals with neuropathic pain showed significantly improved paw withdrawal thresholds (PWTs) following miR23b infusion. Normalizing miR23b expression in tissue lesions, caused by neuropathic pain induction, reduced inflammatory mediators and increased several ROS scavengers. Moreover, Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neurons coexpressed suboptimal levels of miR23b and elevated NOX4/ROS after pain induction at the cellular level. MiR23b finally protects GABAergic neurons against ROS/p38/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated apoptotic death. By evaluating the functional behavior of mice receiving pain/miR23b, normal/anti-miR23b, anti-miR23b/si-NOX4, pain/NOX4 antibody, pain/ascorbic acid, and pain/ascorbic acid/NOX4 antibody, the positive role of miR23b and the negative role of NOX4 in neuropathic pain were confirmed. Based on this study, we conclude that miR23b has a crucial role in the amelioration of neuropathic pain in injured spinal cord by inactivating its target gene, NOX4, and protection of GABAergic neurons from cell death. We finally suggest that infusion of miR23b and NOX4 antibody may provide attractive diagnostic and therapeutic resources for effective pain modulation in neuropathic pain.

23152446	Title	Whole-genome microRNA screening identifies let-7 and mir-18 as regulators of germ layer formation during early embryogenesis.
23152446	Abstract	Tight control over the segregation of endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm is essential for normal embryonic development of all species, yet how neighboring embryonic blastomeres can contribute to different germ layers has never been fully explained. We postulated that microRNAs, which fine-tune many biological processes, might modulate the response of embryonic blastomeres to growth factors and other signals that govern germ layer fate. A systematic screen of a whole-genome microRNA library revealed that the let-7 and miR-18 families increase mesoderm at the expense of endoderm in mouse embryonic stem cells. Both families are expressed in ectoderm and mesoderm, but not endoderm, as these tissues become distinct during mouse and frog embryogenesis. Blocking let-7 function in vivo dramatically affected cell fate, diverting presumptive mesoderm and ectoderm into endoderm. siRNA knockdown of computationally predicted targets followed by mutational analyses revealed that let-7 and miR-18 down-regulate Acvr1b and Smad2, respectively, to attenuate Nodal responsiveness and bias blastomeres to ectoderm and mesoderm fates. These findings suggest a crucial role for the let-7 and miR-18 families in germ layer specification and reveal a remarkable conservation of function from amphibians to mammals.

23159910	Title	Tumor suppressive microRNA-218 inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion through targeting laminin-332 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
23159910	Abstract	Recent our microRNA (miRNA) expression signature revealed that expression of microRNA-218 (miR-218) was reduced in cancer tissues, suggesting a candidate of tumor suppressor in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). The aim of this study was to investigate the functional significance of miR-218 and its mediated moleculer pathways in HNSCC. Restoration of miR-218 in cancer cells led to significant inhibition of cell migration and invasion activities in HNSCC cell lines (FaDu and SAS). Genome-wide gene expression analysis of miR-218 transfectants and in silico database analysis showed that focal adhesion pathway was a promising candidate of miR-218 target pathways. The laminins are an important and biologically active part of the basal lamina, the function of that are various such as influencing cell differentiation, migration and adhesion as well as proliferation and cell survival. Interestingly, all components of laminin-332 (LAMA3, LAMB3 and LAMC2) are listed on the candidate genes in focal adhesion pathway. Furthermore, we focused on LAMB3 which has a miR-218 target site and gene expression studies and luciferase reporter assays showed that LAMB3 was directly regulated by miR-218. Silencing study of LAMB3 demonstrated significant inhibition of cell migration and invasion. In clinical specimens with HNSCC, the expression levels of laminin-332 were significantly upregulated in cancer tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Our analysis data showed that tumor suppressive miR-218 contributes to cancer cell migration and invasion through regulating focal adhesion pathway, especially laminin-332. Tumor suppressive miRNA-mediated novel cancer pathways provide new insights into the potential mechanisms of HNSCC oncogenesis.

23160634	Title	MiR-125b inhibits tumor growth and promotes apoptosis of cervical cancer cells by targeting phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta.
23160634	Abstract	[corrected] microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in cancer-related processes. The miRNA-125b (miR-125b) has been identified as miRNA over-expressed in a wide variety of cancers. However, the role of miR-125b in the context of cervical carcinoma remains unknown. In this study, the effect of miR-125b on the proliferation and apoptosis of human cervical cells was analyzed by MTT assay and Flow cytometry analysis. we identified phosphoinositide 3-kinase catalytic subunit delta (PIK3CD) as a novel miR-125b target. overexpression of miR- 125b in HeLa cervical cancer cells decreased cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and down-regulated expression of PIK3CD. To identify the mechanisms responsible, we investigated the PI3K/Akt pathway and found that PI3K, phospho-Akt, and phospho-mTOR were all down-regulated, while Bid was up-regulated in miR-125b-overexpressing subclones. In vivo, over expression of miR-125b in HeLa cells markedly reduced their ability to form tumors. these results suggest that miR-125b suppresses tumor growth activity by targeting the PI3K/ Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, and may provide a target for effective therapies.

23166713	Title	The expression levels of microRNA-361-5p and its target VEGFA are inversely correlated in human cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.
23166713	Abstract	Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) plays a key role in the angiogenesis of human skin. Elevated levels of VEGFA are associated with several pathological conditions, including chronic inflammatory skin diseases and several types of skin cancer. In particular, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin, the second most common skin cancer in the general population, is characterized by invasive growth, pronounced angiogenesis and elevated levels of VEGFA. The processing, turnover and production of VEGFA are extensively regulated at the post-transcriptional level, both by RNA-binding proteins and microRNAs (miRNAs). In the present study, we identified a new miRNA recognition element in a downstream conserved region of the VEGFA 3'-UTR. We confirmed the repressive effect of miR-361-5p on this element in vitro, identifying the first target for this miRNA. Importantly, we found that miR-361-5p levels are inversely correlated with VEGFA expression in SCC and in healthy skin, indicating that miR-361-5p could play a role in cancers.

23169640	Title	miR-155 targets histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) and impairs transcriptional activity of B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) in the EMiu-miR-155 transgenic mouse model.
23169640	Abstract	Multiple studies have established that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the initiation and progression of cancer. Notably, miR-155 is one of the most overexpressed miRNAs in several solid and hematological malignancies. Ectopic miR-155 expression in mice B cells (EMiu-miR-155 transgenic mice) has been shown to induce pre-B-cell proliferation followed by high-grade lymphoma/leukemia. Loss of miR-155 in mice resulted in impaired immunity due to defective T-cell-mediated immune response. Here we provide a mechanistic insight into miR-155-induced leukemogenesis in the EMiu-miR-155 mouse model through genome-wide transcriptome analysis of naïve B cells and target studies. We found that a key transcriptional repressor and proto-oncogene, Bcl6 is significantly down-regulated in EMiu-miR-155 mice. The reduction of Bcl6 subsequently leads to de-repression of some of the known Bcl6 targets like inhibitor of differentiation (Id2), interleukin-6 (IL6), cMyc, Cyclin D1, and Mip1Alpha/ccl3, all of which promote cell survival and proliferation. We show that Bcl6 is indirectly regulated by miR-155 through Mxd1/Mad1 up-regulation. Interestingly, we found that miR-155 directly targets HDAC4, a corepressor partner of BCL6. Furthermore, ectopic expression of HDAC4 in human-activated B-cell-type diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells results in reduced miR-155-induced proliferation, clonogenic potential, and increased apoptosis. Meta-analysis of the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patient microarray data showed that miR-155 expression is inversely correlated with Bcl6 and Hdac4. Hence this study provides a better understanding of how miR-155 causes disruption of the BCL6 transcriptional machinery that leads to up-regulation of the survival and proliferation genes in miR-155-induced leukemias.

23171795	Title	MicroRNAs reprogram normal fibroblasts into cancer-associated fibroblasts in ovarian cancer.
23171795	Abstract	Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are a major constituent of the tumor stroma, but little is known about how cancer cells transform normal fibroblasts into CAFs. microRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression at a posttranscriptional level. Although it is clearly established that miRNAs are deregulated in human cancers, it is not known whether miRNA expression in resident fibroblasts is affected by their interaction with cancer cells. We found that in ovarian CAFs, miR-31 and miR-214 were downregulated, whereas miR-155 was upregulated when compared with normal or tumor-adjacent fibroblasts. Mimicking this deregulation by transfecting miRNAs and miRNA inhibitors induced a functional conversion of normal fibroblasts into CAFs, and the reverse experiment resulted in the reversion of CAFs into normal fibroblasts. The miRNA-reprogrammed normal fibroblasts and patient-derived CAFs shared a large number of upregulated genes highly enriched in chemokines, which are known to be important for CAF function. The most highly upregulated chemokine, CCL5, (C-C motif ligand 5) was found to be a direct target of miR-214. These results indicate that ovarian cancer cells reprogram fibroblasts to become CAFs through the action of miRNAs. Targeting these miRNAs in stromal cells could have therapeutic benefit. The mechanism by which quiescent fibroblasts are converted into CAFs is unclear. The present study identifies a set of 3 miRNAs that reprogram normal fibroblasts to CAFs. These miRNAs may represent novel therapeutic targets in the tumor microenvironment.

23179556	Title	Anticancer role of MUC1 aptamer-miR-29b chimera in epithelial ovarian carcinoma cells through regulation of PTEN methylation.
23179556	Abstract	Ovarian cancer has a poor prognosis and advanced ovarian cancer lacks effective therapy. In this study, we seek to establish targeting therapy for ovarian cancer through tumor tissue-specific delivery of miRNA-29b to reexpress PTEN tumor-suppressor gene. A chimera (Chi-29b) was constructed to compose of a mucin 1 (MUC1) aptamer targeting tumor cell surface MUC1 protein and miR-29b inhibiting DNA methyltransferases' expression, subsequently reexpressing PTEN gene. The specificity and efficacy of the chimera delivery were analyzed in OVCAR-3 ovarian tumor cells, and the biological activities of the chimera were identified by the expression of its downstream molecules and cell apoptosis. We demonstrated that Chi-29b chimera can be specifically delivered into OVCAR-3 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Dicer efficiently cleaved the Chi-29b chimera to release miR-29b. Chi-29b chimera downregulated Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b protein levels; induced hypomethylation in PTEN promoter; and upregulated PTEN mRNA and protein expression in OVCAR-3 cells. Importantly, Chi-29b chimera significantly induced apoptosis in OVCAR-3 cells. Our study indicated that Chi-29b chimera can effectively exert antitumor effect through specific delivery of miR-29b into OVCAR-3 tumor cells, subsequently reexpressing PTEN gene and inducing cell apoptosis.

23183822	Title	Epigenetic regulation of miRNA-211 by MMP-9 governs glioma cell apoptosis, chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity.
23183822	Abstract	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive brain cancer, and to date, no curative treatment has been developed. In this study, we report that miR-211, a microRNA predicted to target MMP-9, is suppressed in grade IV GBM specimens. Furthermore, we found that miR-211 suppression in GBM involves aberrant methylation-mediated epigenetic silencing of the miR-211 promoter. Indeed, we observed a highly significant inverse correlation between miR-211 expression and MMP-9 protein levels, which is indicative of post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Additionally, shRNA specific for MMP-9 (pM) promoted miR-211 expression via demethylation of miR-211 promoter-associated CpG islands (-140 to +56). In independent experiments, we confirmed that miR-211 overexpression and pM treatments led to the activation of the intrinsic mitochondrial/Caspase-9/3-mediated apoptotic pathway in both glioma cells and cancer stem cells (CSC). We also investigated whether miR-211 is involved in the regulation of MMP-9 and thus plays a functional role in GBM. We found an acute inhibitory effect of miR-211 on glioma cell invasion and migration via suppression of MMP-9. Given the insensitivity of some GBMs to radiation and chemotherapy (temozolomide) along with the hypothesis that glioma CSC cause resistance to therapy, our study indicates that miR-211 or pM in combination with ionizing radiation (IR) and temozolomide significantly induces apoptosis and DNA fragmentation. Of note, miR-211- and pM-treated CSC demonstrated increased drug retention capacity, as observed by MDR1/P-gp mediated-Rhodamine 123 drug efflux activity assay. These results suggest that either rescuing miR-211 expression or downregulation of MMP-9 may have a new therapeutic application for GBM patients in the future.

23185366	Title	The CREB-miR-9 negative feedback minicircuitry coordinates the migration and proliferation of glioma cells.
23185366	Abstract	Migration-proliferation dichotomy is a common mechanism in gliomagenesis; however, an understanding of the exact molecular mechanism of this "go or grow" phenomenon remains largely incomplete. In the present study, we first found that microRNA-9 (miR-9) is highly expressed in glioma cells. MiR-9 inhibited the proliferation and promoted the migration of glioma cells by directly targeting cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and neurofibromin 1 (NF1), respectively. Our data also suggested a migration-inhibitory role for CREB through directly regulating the transcription of NF1. Furthermore, we found that the transcription of miR-9-1 is under CREB's control, forming a negative feedback minicircuitry. Taken together, miR-9 inhibits proliferation but promotes migration, whereas CREB plays a pro-proliferative and anti-migratory role, suggesting that the CREB-miR-9 negative feedback minicircuitry plays a critical role in the determination of "go or grow" in glioma cells.

23187003	Title	microRNA-214-mediated UBC9 expression in glioma.
23187003	Abstract	It has been reported that ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (Ubc9), the unique enzyme2 in the sumoylation pathway, is up-regulated in many cancers. However, the expression and regulation of UBC9 in glioma remains unknown. In this study, we found that Ubc9 was up-regulated in glioma tissues and cell lines compared to a normal control. UBC9 knockdown by small interfering RNA (siRNA) affected cell proliferation and apoptosis in T98G cells. Further experiments revealed that microRNA (miR)-214 directly targeted the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of UBC9 and that there was an inverse relationship between the expression levels of miR-214 and UBC9 protein in glioma tissues and cells. miR-214 overexpression suppressed the endogenous UBC9 protein and affected T98G cell proliferation. These findings suggest that miR-214 reduction facilitates UBC9 expression and is involved in the regulation of glioma cell proliferation.

23190607	Title	MicroRNA-203 contributes to skin re-epithelialization.
23190607	Abstract	Keratinocyte proliferation and migration are crucial steps for the rapid closure of the epidermis during wound healing, but the molecular mechanisms involved in this cellular response remain to be completely elucidated. Here, by in situ hybridization we characterize the expression pattern of miR-203 after the induction of wound in mouse epidermis, showing that its expression is downregulated in the highly proliferating keratinocytes of the 'migrating tongue', whereas it is strongly expressed in the differentiating cells of the skin outside the wound. Furthermore, subcutaneous injections of antagomiR-203 in new born mice dorsal skin strengthened, in vivo, the inverse correlation between miR-203 expression and two new target mRNAs: RAN and RAPH1. Our data suggest that miR-203, by controlling the expression of target proteins that are responsible for both keratinocyte proliferation and migration, exerts a specific role in wound re-epithelialization and epidermal homeostasis re-establishment of injured skin.

23197937	Title	Up-regulated miR-145 expression inhibits porcine preadipocytes differentiation by targeting IRS1.
23197937	Abstract	Generally, most miRNAs that were up-regulated during differentiation promoted adipogenesis, but our research indicated that up-regulation of miR-145 in porcine preadipocytes did not promote but inhibit adipogenesis. In this study, miR-145 was significantly up-regulated during porcine dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells differentiation. In miR-145 overexpressed DFAT cells, adipogenesis was inhibited and triglycerides accumulation was decreased after hormone stimulation (P<0.05). Furthermore, up-regulation of miR-145 expression repressed induction of mRNA levels of adipogenic markers, such as CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein Alpha (C/EBPAlpha), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Gamma2 (PPARGamma2). These effects caused by miR-145 overexpression were mediated by Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) as a mechanism. These data suggested that induced miR-145 expression during differentiation could inhibit adipogenesis by targeting IRS1, and miR-145 may be novel agent for adipose tissue engineering.

23209550	Title	Overexpression of miR-142-5p and miR-155 in gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma resistant to Helicobacter pylori eradication.
23209550	Abstract	microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that can function as endogenous silencers of target genes and play critical roles in human malignancies. To investigate the molecular pathogenesis of gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, the miRNA expression profile was analyzed. miRNA microarray analysis with tissue specimens from gastric MALT lymphomas and surrounding non-tumor mucosae revealed that a hematopoietic-specific miRNA miR-142 and an oncogenic miRNA miR-155 were overexpressed in MALT lymphoma lesions. The expression levels of miR-142-5p and miR-155 were significantly increased in MALT lymphomas which do not respond to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication. The expression levels of miR-142-5p and miR-155 were associated with the clinical courses of gastric MALT lymphoma cases. Overexpression of miR-142-5p and miR-155 was also observed in Helicobacter heilmannii-infected C57BL/6 mice, an animal model of gastric MALT lymphoma. In addition, miR-142-5p and miR-155 suppress the proapoptotic gene TP53INP1 as their target. The results of this study indicate that overexpression of miR-142-5p and miR-155 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of gastric MALT lymphoma. These miRNAs might have potential application as therapeutic targets and novel biomarkers for gastric MALT lymphoma.

23209748	Title	miR-200c sensitizes breast cancer cells to doxorubicin treatment by decreasing TrkB and Bmi1 expression.
23209748	Abstract	Acquired resistance to classical chemotherapeutics is a major obstacle in cancer treatment. Doxorubicin is frequently used in breast cancer therapy either as single-agent or in combination with other drugs like docetaxel and cyclophosphamide. All these chemotherapies have in common that they are administered sequentially and often result in chemoresistance. Here, we mimicked this pulse therapy of breast cancer patients in an in vitro cell culture model, where the epithelial breast cancer cell line BT474 was sequentially treated with doxorubicin for several treatment cycles. In consequence, we obtained chemoresistant cells displaying a mesenchymal-like phenotype with decreased levels of miR-200c. To investigate the involvement of miR-200c in resistance formation, we inhibited and overexpressed miR-200c in different cell lines. Thereby, the cells were rendered more resistant or susceptible to doxorubicin treatment. Moreover, the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB and the transcriptional repressor Bmi1 were identified as miR-200c targets mediating the drug resistance. Hence, we provide a mechanism of acquired resistance to doxorubicin that is caused by the loss of miR-200c. Along with this, our study demonstrates the complex network of microRNA mediated chemoresistance highlighting the challenges in cancer therapy and the importance of novel microRNA-modulating anticancer agents.

23211491	Title	MicroRNA miR-98 inhibits tumor angiogenesis and invasion by targeting activin receptor-like kinase-4 and matrix metalloproteinase-11.
23211491	Abstract	Angiogenesis and invasion are essential processes for solid tumor growth and dissemination. The tumor development process can be dependent on the activation of a series of signaling pathways, including growth factor-activated pathways. MicroRNAs have been shown to be critical for tumorigenesis, but their roles in cancer angiogenesis, invasion and other signaling pathways important for tumor development are still unclear in the context of tumor biology. We investigated the role of microRNA miR-98 in regulating tumor growth, invasion, and angiogenesis using a highly aggressive breast cancer model in vitro and in vitro. We found that the expression of miR-98 inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation, survival, tumor growth, invasion, and angiogenesis. Conversely, inhibition of endogenous miR-98 promoted cell proliferation, survival, tumor growth, invasion, and angiogenesis. It appeared that miR-98 inhibited angiogenesis by modulating endothelial cell activities including cell spreading, cell invasion and tubule formation. Interestingly, miR-98 reduced the expression of ALK4 and MMP11, both of which were potential targets of miR-98. Transfection of an anti-miR-98 construct increased the expression of both targets. We confirmed that mir-98 targeted the 3'-untranslated regions of ALK4 and MMP11. Finally, ALK4- and MMP11-specific siRNAs inhibited breast cancer cell proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Rescue experiments with ALK4 and MMP11 constructs reversed the anti-proliferative, anti-invasive and anti-angiogenic effects of miR-98. Our findings define a regulatory role of miR-98 in tumor angiogenesis and invasion through repressed ALK4 and MMP11 expression.

23226395	Title	Hepatitis C virus mediated changes in miRNA-449a modulates inflammatory biomarker YKL40 through components of the NOTCH signaling pathway.
23226395	Abstract	Liver disease due to hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an important health problem worldwide. HCV induced changes in microRNAs (miRNA) are shown to mediate inflammation leading to liver fibrosis. Gene expression analyses identified dysregulation of miRNA-449a in HCV patients but not in alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver diseases. By sequence analysis of the promoter for YKL40, an inflammatory marker upregulated in patients with chronic liver diseases with fibrosis, adjacent binding sites for nuclear factor of Kappa B/P65 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPAlpha) were identified. P65 interacted with CEBPAlpha to co-operatively activate YKL40 expression through sequence specific DNA binding. In vitro analysis demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFAlpha) mediated YKL40 expression is regulated by miRNA-449a and its target NOTCH1 in human hepatocytes.NOTCH1 facilitated nuclear localization of P65 in response to TNFAlpha. Further, HCV patients demonstrated upregulation of NOTCH1 along with downregulation of miRNA-449a. Taken together it is demonstrated that miRNA-449a plays an important role in modulating expression of YKL40 through targeting the components of the NOTCH signaling pathway following HCV infection. Therefore, defining transcriptional regulatory mechanisms which control inflammatory responses and fibrosis will be important towards developing strategies to prevent hepatic fibrosis especially following HCV recurrence in liver transplant recipients.

23226399	Title	MiR-101 and miR-144 regulate the expression of the CFTR chloride channel in the lung.
23226399	Abstract	The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel that plays a critical role in the lung by maintaining fluid homeostasis. Absence or malfunction of CFTR leads to Cystic Fibrosis, a disease characterized by chronic infection and inflammation. We recently reported that air pollutants such as cigarette smoke and cadmium negatively regulate the expression of CFTR by affecting several steps in the biogenesis of CFTR protein. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently received a great deal of attention as both biomarkers and therapeutics due to their ability to regulate multiple genes. Here, we show that cigarette smoke and cadmium up-regulate the expression of two miRNAs (miR-101 and miR-144) that are predicted to target CFTR in human bronchial epithelial cells. When premature miR-101 and miR-144 were transfected in human airway epithelial cells, they directly targeted the CFTR 3'UTR and suppressed the expression of the CFTR protein. Since miR-101 was highly up-regulated by cigarette smoke in vitro, we investigated whether such increase also occurred in vivo. Mice exposed to cigarette smoke for 4 weeks demonstrated an up-regulation of miR-101 and suppression of CFTR protein in their lungs. Finally, we show that miR-101 is highly expressed in lung samples from patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) when compared to control patients. Taken together, these results suggest that chronic cigarette smoking up-regulates miR-101 and that this miRNA could contribute to suppression of CFTR in the lungs of COPD patients.

23227140	Title	Gadd45Alpha: a novel diabetes-associated gene potentially linking diabetic cardiomyopathy and baroreflex dysfunction.
23227140	Abstract	Both diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) and baroreflex dysfunction independently contribute to sudden cardiac death (SCD), however the inherent connections between them under diabetic state remains unclear. As microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to participate in various physiological and pathological processes, we presume they may also be involved in DCM and DM-induced impairment of baroreflex sensitivity. Two sets of gene expression profiles data from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic heart and diabetic dorsal root ganglia (DDRG) were retrieved from GEO and ArrayExpress. Co-differentially-expressed genes in diabetic heart and DDRG were identified by t test and intersection analysis. Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) was applied to find direct interacting proteins of Gadd45Alpha. Differentially-expressed miRNAs in left ventricle from 4-week STZ-induced diabetic rats were screened by miRNA microarray. Expression of miR-499 and its regulating effect on Gadd45Alpha were then verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), western blot, computational predication, and dual-luciferase reporter analysis. Four co-differentially-expressed genes in DCM and DDRG were identified. Among these genes, Gadd45Alpha has 16 direct interacting proteins and 11 of them are documentedly associated with DM. Accompanied with significantly increased miR-499 expression, Gadd45Alpha expression was increased at mRNA level but decreased at protein level in both diabetic heart and nucleus ambiguous. Furthermore, miR-499 was confirmed negatively regulating Gadd45Alpha by targeting its 3'UTR. Collectively, reduced Gadd45Alpha protein expression by forced miR-499 expression indicated it's a diabetes-associated gene which might potentially be involved in both DCM and DM-induced baroreflex dysfunction.

23227223	Title	The role of the 3'UTR region in the regulation of the ACVR1/Alk-2 gene expression.
23227223	Abstract	The ACVR1/Alk-2 gene, encoding a BMP type I receptor, is mutated in Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva, a severe form of heterotopic ossification. Regulation of ACVR1/Alk-2 expression, still poorly understood, is likely to be controlled by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. In our work, we focused on the functional role of the 3'UTR region of the gene and on microRNAs as possible modulators of the ACVR1/Alk-2 expression. The ACVR1/Alk-2 3'UTR region consists of a 1.1 kb sequence harboring several putative, well-conserved binding sites for miRNAs in its proximal half, and AU-rich elements in the distal one, as assessed by bioinformatic analysis. The functional role of this region was tested in presence of transcription inhibitors and in transfection experiments in different cell lines, with a ACVR1/Alk-2-3'UTR reporter construct. By this transfection-based approach, we have also verified that three microRNAs, among those predicted to target ACVR1/Alk-2 gene by in silico analysis, can bind its 3'UTR sequence thereby modulating its expression. In this work we demonstrated that the ACVR1/Alk-2 transcript is unstable in presence of inhibitors of transcription. Functional analysis of the 3'UTR region by Luciferase reporter assays showed that it plays an inhibitory role on ACVR1/Alk-2 gene expression. Moreover, we found that specific miRNAs are involved in modulating ACVR1/Alk-2 gene expression as suggested by binding sites prediction in its 3'UTR sequence. In particular, we found that mir148b and mir365 were able to down-regulate ACVR1/Alk-2 expression, whereas mir26a showed a positive effect on its mRNA. Our data contribute to elucidate some of the mechanisms intervening in the modulation of ACVR1/Alk-2 expression. Considering that no specific and effective treatment of FOP is available, clarifying the basic mechanisms of the ACVR1/Alk-2 gene biology may provide means to develop innovative therapeutics approaches.

23233482	Title	miRNA-145 targets v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 to suppress the invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis of gastric cancer cells.
23233482	Abstract	Recent evidence shows that v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homolog 1 (Ets1) is implicated in tumor development and progression. However, the clinical potentials and underlying mechanisms of Ets1 in gastric cancer progression and metastasis remain largely unknown. In this study, Ets1 immunostaining was identified in 56 of 84 (66.7%) gastric cancer tissues, which was correlated with tumor invasion and metastasis. In gastric cancer specimens and cell lines, miRNA-145 (miR-145) was downregulated and inversely correlated with Ets1 expression. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-145 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of Ets1 mRNA. Overexpression or knockdown of miR-145 responsively altered both the mRNA and protein levels of Ets1 and its downstream genes, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-1)-1 and -9, in gastric cancer cell lines SGC-7901 and MKN-45. Ectopic expression of miR-145 suppressed the invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis of SGC-7901 and MKN-45 cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the effects of miR-145 on Ets1 expression, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis were rescued by restoration of Ets1 expression in these cells. Furthermore, anti-miR-145 inhibitor promoted the migration, invasion, and angiogenesis, whereas siRNA-mediated Ets1 knockdown phenocopied the effects of miR-145 overexpression in gastric cancer cells. These results show that miR-145 suppresses Ets1 expression via the binding site in the 3'-UTR, thus inhibiting the invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis of gastric cancer cells.

23236401	Title	MiR-27a functions as a tumor suppressor in acute leukemia by regulating 14-3-3Theta.
23236401	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRs) play major roles in normal hematopoietic differentiation and hematopoietic malignancies. In this work, we report that miR-27a, and its coordinately expressed cluster (miR-23a∼miR-27a∼miR-24-2), was down-regulated in acute leukemia cell lines and primary samples compared to hematopoietic stem-progenitor cells (HSPCs). Decreased miR-23a cluster expression in some acute leukemia cell lines was mediated by c-MYC. Replacement of miR-27a in acute leukemia cell lines inhibited cell growth due, at least in part, to increased cellular apoptosis. We identified a member of the anti-apoptotic 14-3-3 family of proteins, which support cell survival by interacting with and negatively regulating pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax and Bad, as a target of miR-27a. Specifically, miR-27a regulated 14-3-3Theta at both the mRNA and protein levels. These data indicate that miR-27a contributes a tumor suppressor-like activity in acute leukemia cells via regulation of apoptosis, and that miR-27a and 14-3-3Theta may be potential therapeutic targets.

23242208	Title	microRNA-372 maintains oncogene characteristics by targeting TNFAIP1 and affects NFKappaB signaling in human gastric carcinoma cells.
23242208	Abstract	Aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression has been investigated in gastric cancer, which is one of the most common malignancies. However, the roles of miRNAs in gastric cancer remain largely unknown. In the present study, we found that microRNA-372 (miR-372) directly targets tumor necrosis factor, Alpha-induced protein 1 (TNFAIP1), and is involved in the regulation of the NFKappaB signaling pathway. Furthermore, overexpression of TNFAIP1 induced changes in AGS cells similar to those in AGS cells treated with miR-372-ASO. Collectively, these findings demonstrate an oncogenic role for miR-372 in controlling cell growth and apoptosis through downregulation of TNFAIP1. This novel molecular basis provides new insights into the etiology of gastric cancer.

23246964	Title	Genetic variations in miR-27a gene decrease mature miR-27a level and reduce gastric cancer susceptibility.
23246964	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that function as post-transcriptional regulators of tumor oncogenes and suppressors. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA genes are a novel class of genetic variations in the human genome that are currently being identified and investigated in human cancers. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether SNPs in the miR-27a gene affect miR-27a expression and alter susceptibility to gastric cancer. Therefore, we conducted a case-control population study and the allele and genotype frequencies for polymorphism rs11671784 in miR-27a gene were examined in the study population. As a result, we found that the G/A polymorphism in the miR-27a gene exhibited a significant effect on gastric cancer risk. Compared with GG homozygotes, subjects who were GA heterozygotes or AA homozygotes exhibited a decreased risk of gastric cancer. The G/A polymorphism impaired the processing of pre-miR-27a to mature miR-27a, resulting in significantly reduced expression of mature miR-27a and an increased level of its target HOXA10. Furthermore, we confirmed these findings in in vitro studies by overexpressing pre-miR-27a carrying G or A allele. It provided further evidence demonstrating that allelic difference of rs11671784 is linked to gastric tumorigenesis. In summary, our results indicate that the G/A polymorphism in miR-27a gene (rs11671784) decreases miR-27a expression, reduces gastric cancer risk and plays a role in gastric tumorigenesis. This is the first study to address the role and function of miR-27a polymorphism rs11671784 in gastric cancer. These results could be useful to assess individual susceptibility of gastric cancer and will improve our understanding of the potential contribution of miRNA SNPs to cancer pathogenesis.

23250421	Title	Elevated oncofoetal miR-17-5p expression regulates colorectal cancer progression by repressing its target gene P130.
23250421	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are essential for regulating normal embryonic development and carcinogenesis. Here we report that miR-17-5p, an oncofoetal miRNA, is a key regulator of colorectal cancer progression. We show that miR-17-5p is an oncogenic miRNA that regulates tumorigenesis and progression by targeting the gene encoding P130 and subsequently activating the Wnt/Beta-catenin pathway. Using specimens from two large cohorts of colorectal cancer patients, we found that patients whose tumours had high miR-17-5p expression had shorter overall survival rates but showed a better response to adjuvant chemotherapy than did patients whose tumours had low miRNA expression. We also observed a strong inverse correlation between miR-17-5p and P130 expression. The current findings suggest that miR-17-5p is a crucial determinant of colorectal cancer progression.

23251334	Title	SOX4 transcriptionally regulates multiple SEMA3/plexin family members and promotes tumor growth in pancreatic cancer.
23251334	Abstract	Semaphorin signaling through Plexin frequently participates in tumorigenesis and malignant progression in various types of cancer. In particular, the role of semaphorin signaling in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains unexplored, despite a high likelihood of metastasis and mortality. Unlike other epithelial malignancies that often express a small number of specific genes in the Semaphorin/Plexin family, five or more are often expressed in human PDAC. Such concomitant expression of these SEMA3/Plexin family members is not a result of gene amplification, but (at least partially) from increased gene transcription activated by SOX4 de novo expressed in PDAC. Via chromatin-immunoprecipitation, luciferase promoter activity assay and electrophoresis mobility shift assay, SOX4 is demonstrated to bind to the consensus site at the promoter of each SEMA3 and Plexin gene to enhance transcription activity. Conversely, RNAi-knockdown of SOX4 in PDAC cell lines results in decreased expression of SEMA3/Plexin family members and is associated with restricted tumor growth both in vitro and in SCID mice. We further demonstrate that SOX4 levels parallel with the summed expression of SEMA3/Plexin family members (P = 0.033, NPar Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis), which also correlates with poor survival in human PDAC (P = 0.0409, Kaplan-Meier analysis). Intriguingly, miR-129-2 and miR-335, both of which target SOX4 for degradation, are co-repressed in human PDAC cases associated with up-regulated SOX4 in a statistically significant way. In conclusion, we disclose a miR-129-2(miR-335)/SOX4/Semaphorin-Plexin regulatory axis in the tumorigenesis of pancreatic cancer.

23263626	Title	An endothelial apelin-FGF link mediated by miR-424 and miR-503 is disrupted in pulmonary arterial hypertension.
23263626	Abstract	Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is characterized by vascular remodeling associated with obliteration of pulmonary arterioles and formation of plexiform lesions composed of hyperproliferative endothelial and vascular smooth-muscle cells. Here we describe a microRNA (miRNA)-dependent association between apelin (APLN) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) signaling in pulmonary artery endothelial cells (PAECs). APLN deficiency in these cells led to increased expression of FGF2 and its receptor FGFR1 as a consequence of decreased expression of miR-424 and miR-503, which directly target FGF2 and FGFR1. miR-424 and miR-503 were downregulated in PAH, exerted antiproliferative effects in PAECs and inhibited the capacity of PAEC-conditioned medium to induce the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth-muscle cells. Reconstitution of miR-424 and miR-503 in vivo ameliorated pulmonary hypertension in experimental models. These studies identify an APLN-dependent miRNA-FGF signaling axis needed for the maintenance of pulmonary vascular homeostasis.

23264087	Title	Expression and regulatory function of miRNA-34a in targeting survivin in gastric cancer cells.
23264087	Abstract	We aimed to investigate the expression of microRNA-34a (miR-34a) in human gastric cancer cells and to evaluate the effects of miR-34a, acting via its gene survivin, on gastric cancer cell HGC-27 to provide potential new strategies for treating gastric cancer. In vitro cultures of the human gastric cancer cell lines MGC80-3, HGC-27, NCI-N87, and SGC-7901 and the normal human gastric epithelial cell line GES-1 were established. The expression of miR-34a in each gastric cancer cell line and GES-1 normal human gastric epithelial cell line was detected using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). After the HGC-27 cells were transfected with a miR-34a mimic for 48 h, the changes in the expression levels of miR-34a were detected using qRT-PCR. The effect of miR-34a on HGC-27 cell viability was measured using a tetrazolium-based colorimetric [-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo-(-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide (MTT)] assay. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the effects of miR-34a on HGC-27 cell proliferation. Annexin V/propidium iodide double staining and flow cytometry were used to analyze the effects of miR-34a on HGC-27 cell apoptosis. A Transwell invasion chamber was used to detect the effects of miR-34a on HGC-27 cell invasion. Finally, western blotting was used to analyze the effects of miR-34a on survivin protein expression. The qRT-PCR test determined that miR-34a expression in gastric cancer cells was significantly reduced compared to the normal gastric epithelial cell line GES-1 (p < 0.01). Compared to the control group, cellular miR-34a expression levels were significantly increased in HGC-27 human gastric carcinoma cells after transfection with a miR-34a mimic for 48 h (p < 0.01). The MTT assay demonstrated that after overexpressing miR-34a in HGC-27 cells, cellular viability was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). Flow cytometry analysis determined that upon miR-34a overexpression, the proliferation index decreased significantly (p < 0.05), and cellular apoptosis was significantly increased (p < 0.01). The Transwell invasion chamber assay illustrated that after increasing the expression of miR-34a, the number of cells passing through the Transwell chamber was significantly reduced (p < 0.01). Based on western blotting, compared with the control group, survivin protein expression levels were significantly decreased in the HGC-27 cells transfected with the miR-34a mimic for 48 h (p < 0.01). In conclusion, the expression level of miR-34a was downregulated in human gastric cancer cell lines. miR-34a can negatively regulate survivin protein expression and inhibit gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Therapeutically enhancing miR-34a expression or silencing the survivin gene may benefit patients with gastric cancer.

23284895	Title	Discovery of MicroRNAs associated with myogenesis by deep sequencing of serial developmental skeletal muscles in pigs.
23284895	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, single-stranded non-coding RNAs that repress their target genes by binding their 3' UTRs. These RNAs play critical roles in myogenesis. To gain knowledge about miRNAs involved in the regulation of myogenesis, porcine longissimus muscles were collected from 18 developmental stages (33-, 40-, 45-, 50-, 55-, 60-, 65-, 70-, 75-, 80-, 85-, 90-, 95-, 100- and 105-day post-gestation fetuses, 0 and 10-day postnatal piglets and adult pigs) to identify miRNAs using Solexa sequencing technology. We detected 197 known miRNAs and 78 novel miRNAs according to comparison with known miRNAs in the miRBase (release 17.0) database. Moreover, variations in sequence length and single nucleotide polymorphisms were also observed in 110 known miRNAs. Expression analysis of the 11 most abundant miRNAs were conducted using quantitative PCR (qPCR) in eleven tissues (longissimus muscles, leg muscles, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, stomach, small intestine and colon), and the results revealed that ssc-miR-378, ssc-miR-1 and ssc-miR-206 were abundantly expressed in skeletal muscles. During skeletal muscle development, the expression level of ssc-miR-378 was low at 33 days post-coitus (dpc), increased at 65 and 90 dpc, peaked at postnatal day 0, and finally declined and maintained a comparatively stable level. This expression profile suggested that ssc-miR-378 was a new candidate miRNA for myogenesis and participated in skeletal muscle development in pigs. Target prediction and KEGG pathway analysis suggested that bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1), both of which were relevant to proliferation and differentiation, might be the potential targets of miR-378. Luciferase activities of report vectors containing the 3'UTR of porcine BMP2 or MAPK1 were downregulated by miR-378, which suggested that miR-378 probably regulated myogenesis though the regulation of these two genes.

23285024	Title	Genomic loss of tumor suppressor miRNA-204 promotes cancer cell migration and invasion by activating AKT/mTOR/Rac1 signaling and actin reorganization.
23285024	Abstract	Increasing evidence suggests that chromosomal regions containing microRNAs are functionally important in cancers. Here, we show that genomic loci encoding miR-204 are frequently lost in multiple cancers, including ovarian cancers, pediatric renal tumors, and breast cancers. MiR-204 shows drastically reduced expression in several cancers and acts as a potent tumor suppressor, inhibiting tumor metastasis in vivo when systemically delivered. We demonstrated that miR-204 exerts its function by targeting genes involved in tumorigenesis including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin family member which is known to promote tumor angiogenesis and invasiveness. Analysis of primary tumors shows that increased expression of BDNF or its receptor tropomyosin-related kinase B (TrkB) parallel a markedly reduced expression of miR-204. Our results reveal that loss of miR-204 results in BDNF overexpression and subsequent activation of the small GTPase Rac1 and actin reorganization through the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway leading to cancer cell migration and invasion. These results suggest that microdeletion of genomic loci containing miR-204 is directly linked with the deregulation of key oncogenic pathways that provide crucial stimulus for tumor growth and metastasis. Our findings provide a strong rationale for manipulating miR-204 levels therapeutically to suppress tumor metastasis.

23285084	Title	miR-17-5p regulates endocytic trafficking through targeting TBC1D2/Armus.
23285084	Abstract	miRNA cluster miR-17-92 is known as oncomir-1 due to its potent oncogenic function. miR-17-92 is a polycistronic cluster that encodes 6 miRNAs, and can both facilitate and inhibit cell proliferation. Known targets of miRNAs encoded by this cluster are largely regulators of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Here, we show that miRNAs encoded by this cluster and sharing the seed sequence of miR-17 exert their influence on one of the most essential cellular processes - endocytic trafficking. By mRNA expression analysis we identified that regulation of endocytic trafficking by miR-17 can potentially be achieved by targeting of a number of trafficking regulators. We have thoroughly validated TBC1D2/Armus, a GAP of Rab7 GTPase, as a novel target of miR-17. Our study reveals regulation of endocytic trafficking as a novel function of miR-17, which might act cooperatively with other functions of miR-17 and related miRNAs in health and disease.

23285158	Title	Modulation by cocaine of dopamine receptors through miRNA-133b in zebrafish embryos.
23285158	Abstract	The use of cocaine during pregnancy can affect the mother and indirectly might alter the development of the embryo/foetus. Accordingly, in the present work our aim was to study in vivo (in zebrafish embryos) the effects of cocaine on the expression of dopamine receptors and on miR-133b. These embryos were exposed to cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) at 5 hours post-fertilization (hpf) and were then collected at 8, 16, 24, 48 and 72 hpf to study the expression of dopamine receptors, drd1, drd2a, drd2b and drd3, by quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH, only at 24 hpf). Our results indicate that cocaine alters the expression of the genes studied, depending on the stage of the developing embryo and the type of dopamine receptor. We found that cocaine reduced the expression of miR-133b at 24 and 48 hpf in the central nervous system (CNS) and at the periphery by qPCR and also that the spatial distribution of miR-133b was mainly seen in somites, a finding that suggests the involvement of miR-133b in the development of the skeletal muscle. In contrast, at the level of the CNS miR-133b had a weak and moderate expression at 24 and 48 hpf. We also analysed the interaction of miR-133b with the Pitx3 and Pitx3 target genes drd2a and drd2b, tyrosine hydroxylase (th) and dopamine transporter (dat) by microinjection of the Pitx3-3'UTR sequence. Microinjection of Pitx3-3'UTR affected the expression of pitx3, drd2a, drd2b, th and dat. In conclusion, in the present work we describe a possible mechanism to account for cocaine activity by controlling miR-133b transcription in zebrafish. Via miR-133b cocaine would modulate the expression of pitx3 and subsequently of dopamine receptors, dat and th. These results indicate that miRNAs can play an important role during embryogenesis and in drug addiction.

23285182	Title	Up-regulation of microRNA-126 may contribute to pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis via regulating NF-kappaB inhibitor IKappaBAlpha.
23285182	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators. Altered expression of miRNAs has recently demonstrated association with human ulcerative colitis (UC). In this study, we attempted to elucidate the roles of miR-126 in the pathogenesis of UC. Expression of miR-126, miR-21, miR-375 and the potential targets NF-KappaB inhibitor alpha (IKappaBAlpha, IKBA or NFKBIA), Polo-like kinase 2 (PLK2) and v-Crk sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene homolog (CRK) were assessed in 52 colonic biopsies from patients with active UC, inactive UC, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and from healthy subjects by quantitative RT-PCR and immunofluorescence analyses. Regulation of gene expression by miR-126 was assessed using luciferase reporter construct assays and specific miRNA mimic transfection. We found that the expression of miR-126 and miR-21 were significantly increased in active UC group compared to the inactive UC, IBS and healthy control groups (P<0.05). In contrast, the expression of IKBA mRNA and protein was remarkably decreased in the active UC group compared with the other three groups (P<0.05). The expression of miR-126 and IKBA mRNA were inversely correlated in active UC patients (P<0.05). However the expression of miR-375, PLK2 and CRK showed no difference between each group. Furthermore, we demonstrate that endogenous miR-126 and exogenous miR-126 mimic can inhibit IKappaBAlpha expression. Finally, mutating the miR-126 binding site of the IKBA 3'-UTR reporter construct restored reporter gene expression. miR-126 may play roles in UC inflammatory activity by down-regulating the expression of IKBA, an important inhibitor of NF-KappaB signaling pathway.

23300839	Title	MicroRNA-138 suppresses neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin expression and inhibits tumorigenicity.
23300839	Abstract	The expression of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is up-regulated in some cancers; therefore NGAL has potential as a tumor biomarker. Although the regulation mechanism for this is unknown, one study has shown that it is likely to involve a microRNA (miRNA). Here, we investigate the relation between miRNA expression and NGAL expression, and the role of NGAL in tumorigenesis. Using miRNA target-detecting software, we analyze the mRNA sequence of NGAL and identify a target site for microRNA-138 (miR-138) in nucleotides 25-53 of the 3' UTR. We then analyze NGAL and miR-138 expression in three cancer cell lines originating from breast, endometrial and pancreatic carcinomas (the MCF-7, RL95-2 and AsPC-1 cell lines), respectively, using quantitative (real-time) PCR and western blot analysis. Metastasis is a critical event in cancer progression, in which malignant cell proliferation, migration and invasion increase. To determine whether miR-138-regulated NGAL expression is associated with metastasis, the proliferation and migration of the cell line are examined after miR-138 transfection. Using nude mice, we examine both the tumorigenicity of these cell lines and of miR-138-transfected cancer cells in vivo, as well as the effect of treating tumors with an antibody against NGAL. Our results show that these cancer cell lines down-regulate NGAL when miR-138 is highly expressed. Ectopic transfection of miR-138 suppresses NGAL expression and cell migration in RL95-2 and AsPC-1 cells, demonstrating that miR-138-regulated NGAL expression is associated with cell migration. Additionally, injection of the NGAL antibody diminishes NGAL-mediated tumorigenesis in nude mice, and miR-138 transfection of cancer cells reduces tumor formation. As the cell proliferation data showed that the tumor size should be regulated by NGAL-related cell growth. Taken together, our results indicate that NGAL may be a good target for cancer therapy and suggest that miR-138 acts as a tumor suppressor and may prevent metastasis.

23301798	Title	MicroRNA-126 regulates the induction and function of CD4(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells through PI3K/AKT pathway.
23301798	Abstract	Recent evidence showed that limited activation of PI3K/Akt pathway was critical for induction and function sustainment of CD4(+) Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs). However, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we reported that miR-126 was expressed in mouse and human Tregs. Further study showed that silencing of miR-126 using miR-126 antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) could significantly reduce the induction of Tregs in vitro. Furthermore, miR-126 silencing could obviously reduce the expression of Foxp3 on Tregs, which was accompanied by decreased expression of CTLA-4 and GITR, as well as IL-10 and TGF-Beta, and impair its suppressive function. Mechanistic evidence showed that silencing of miR-126 enhanced the expression of its target p85Beta and subsequently altered the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway, which was ultimately responsible for reduced induction and suppressive function of Tregs. Finally, we further revealed that miR-126 silencing could impair the suppressive function of Tregs in vivo and endow effectively antitumour effect of CD8(+) T cells in adoptive cell transfer assay using a murine breast cancer model. Therefore, our study showed that miR-126 could act as fine-tuner in regulation of PI3K-Akt pathway transduction in the induction and sustained suppressive function of Tregs and provided a novel insight into the development of therapeutic strategies for promoting T-cell immunity by regulating Tregs through targeting specific miRNAs.

23322197	Title	MicroRNA-18a modulates STAT3 activity through negative regulation of PIAS3 during gastric adenocarcinogenesis.
23322197	Abstract	MicroRNA (miRNA, miR)-18a is a member of the miR-17-92 cluster, an important locus that is markedly overexpressed in several cancers and associated with cancer development and progression. However, the mechanism of action of the miR-17-92 cluster and its individual miRNAs are largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of the miR-17-92 cluster by in situ hybridisation (ISH) assay and copy-number analysis in gastric tissue microarray (TMA) specimens. We determined that miR-18a was present at higher levels than the other five miRNAs in the cluster. In addition, we identified Protein Inhibitor of Activated Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (PIAS3) as a direct target of miR-18a in gastric cancer. miR-18a level was positively correlated with levels of Survivin, Bcl-xL, and c-Myc, which are downstream transcriptional targets of Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3). STAT3-induced transcription can be negatively regulated by PIAS3; consistent with this, PIAS3 level was negatively correlated with levels of Survivin, Bcl-xL, and c-Myc. Our findings indicate that miR-18a acts as an oncogene and plays a role in gastric adenocarcinogenesis, at least in part by negatively regulating PIAS3 and thereby modulating expression of STAT3 target genes.

23333058	Title	miR-17-5p/20a are important markers for gastric cancer and murine double minute 2 participates in their functional regulation.
23333058	Abstract	To investigate the potential roles and mechanisms of miR-17-5p/20a in human gastric cancer development and progression. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was employed to determine miR-17-5p/20a expression profiles in 110 gastric cancer tissues. microRNAs' (miRNAs) mimics and inhibitors were used to reveal their function in gastric cancer. Antagomirs were applied to treating gastric cancer cell derived xenograft in vivo. Western blot and luciferase assays were performed to uncover the targets and mechanisms of miR-17-5p/20a. miR-17-5p/20a levels were upregulated in human gastric cancer tissues. Overexpression of miR-17-5p/20a promoted gastric cancer cell cycle progression and inhibited cell apoptosis, whereas knockdown of miR-17-5p/20a resulted in cell cycle arrest and increased apoptosis. p21 and tumour protein p53-induced nuclear protein 1 (TP53INP1) were validated as the targets of miR-17-5p/20a. Antagomirs against miR-17-5p/20a significantly inhibited gastric cancer growth via upregulation of p21 and TP53INP1 in a mouse xenograft model. The negative relationship between miR-17-5p/20a and TP53INP1 was observed in patient gastric cancer tissues. Murine double minute 2 (MDM2) was found to be involved in miRNA regulation and function. Targeted inhibition of MDM2 in a miRNA mimic-transfected gastric cancer cell line abolished miR-17-5p/20a function and inhibition of p21 expression. MDM2 restoration by pCMV-MDM2 rescued the functionality. Our findings indicate that miR-17-5p/20a promote gastric cancer cell proliferation and inhibit cell apoptosis via post-transcriptional modulation of p21 and TP53INP1. They may be promising therapeutic markers for gastric cancer. MDM2 contributes to miR-17-5p/20a function and inhibition of p21 in gastric cancer, and may be a novel mechanism underlying the oncogenic roles of miR-17-5p/20a.

23333942	Title	MicroRNA-195 and microRNA-378 mediate tumor growth suppression by epigenetical regulation in gastric cancer.
23333942	Abstract	The epigenetic regulation of microRNAs is one of several mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis. We found that microRNA-195 (miR-195) and microRNA-378 (miR-378) were significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and gastric cancer cell lines. The expression of miR-195 and miR-378 in gastric cancer cells was significantly restored by 5-aza-dC, a demethylation reagent. The low expression of miR-195 and miR-378 was closely related to the presence of promoter CpG island methylation. Treatment with miR-195/miR-378 mimics strikingly suppressed the growth of gastric cancer cells whereas promoted the growth of normal gastric epithelial cells. In contrast, administration of miR-195/miR-378 inhibitors significantly prevented the growth of normal gastric epithelial cells. Expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 6 and vascular endothelial growth factor was down-regulated by exogenous miR-195 and miR-378, respectively. In conclusion, miR-195 and miR-378 are abnormally expressed and epigenetically regulated in gastric cancer cell lines and tissues via the suppression of CDK6 and VEGF signaling, suggesting that miR-195 and miR-378 have tumor suppressor properties in gastric cancer.

23353818	Title	MicroRNA-296-5p increases proliferation in gastric cancer through repression of Caudal-related homeobox 1.
23353818	Abstract	Caudal-related homeobox 1 (CDX1), an intestinal-specific transcription factor, has been reported to have vital roles in gastric intestinal metaplasia (IM). Although IM is a high-risk factor for gastric cancer (GC), the specific role of CDX1 in GC is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression of CDX1 and its functional roles in GC, and its upstream regulatory mechanisms at the microRNA (miRNA) level were further explored. We found that CDX1 is lost in GC when compared with adjacent IM tissues. Gain-of-function studies showed that CDX1 significantly inhibited GC cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Interestingly, we identified and verified an onco-mir, miR-296-5p, as a direct upstream regulator of CDX1. miR-296-5p overexpression significantly promoted GC cell growth and attenuated the CDX1-induced anti-growth effects by recurring cell cycle distribution and apoptotic status, whereas knockdown of miR-296-5p decreased GC cell growth. Furthermore, we found that the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) activation and the subsequent downstream changes in protein levels related to cell cycle and apoptosis partly account for the miR-296-5p-CDX1-induced GC growth promotion. In addition, the detection of miR-296-5p and expression of CDX1 in primary GC tissues and adjacent IM tissues revealed that miR-296-5p is inversely correlated with CDX1, further supporting our in vitro results. Our results showed an anti-growth effect of CDX1 and identified its miRNA regulatory mechanism in GC. The identification of this novel miR-296-5p-CDX1-ERK1/2 axis sheds new light on the understanding of the process from IM to GC and may provide therapeutic targets for the treatment of GC.

23372348	Title	TGF-Beta1 alters microRNA profile in human gastric cancer cells.
23372348	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators that play a key role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Transforming growth factor-Beta1 (TGF-Beta1) is involved in invasion and metastasis in many tumors. In this study, we investigated the microRNAs (miRNA) profiles altered by TGF-Beta1 in gastric cancer (GC) cells. We detected the expression profiles of miRNA by miRNA microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Migration and invasion, wound-healing assay, prediction of miRNA targets, Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis were carried out to determine the role of one selected miRNA, namely miR-193b, in affecting the biological behaviors of GC BGC823 cells. Among 847 human miRNAs in the microarray, three miRNAs (miR-27a, miR-29b-1 and miR-194) were up-regulated and three (miR-574-3p, miR-193b and miR-130b) were down-regulated in BGC823 cells treated with TGF-Beta1 compared with control. miR-193b suppressed the invasion and metastasis of GC cells in vivo and in vitro, and down-regulated urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) protein in GC cells. TGF-Beta1 altered miRNA expression profile in BGC823 cells. Among the altered miRNAs, TGF-Beta1 induced the down-regulation of miR-193b, which inhibited cell invasion and metastasis in vivo and in vitro, and down-regulated uPA protein in GC cells.

23381389	Title	Downregulated microRNA-200a promotes EMT and tumor growth through the wnt/Beta-catenin pathway by targeting the E-cadherin repressors ZEB1/ZEB2 in gastric adenocarcinoma.
23381389	Abstract	In a previous study, we found that microRNA (miRNA)-200a suppresses Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling by interacting with Beta-catenin, thereby inhibiting migration, invasion and proliferation. However, the mechanism involved in this suppression remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the underlying mechanism of miR-200a regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in gastric carcinoma cells, and confirmed the tumor suppressor role of miR-200a in vivo. The expressions of miRNA-200a, -200b and -200c, identified by fluorescent in situ hybridization, were downregulated and inversely correlated with WHO grades of gastric adenocarcinoma (GA). The expression of the potential miR-200a target genes ZEB1 and ZEB2 was detected immunohistochemically. These examinations used the same tissue microarrays to analyze the relationships between miR-200a and potential target genes. The expression of miR-200a and ZEB1/ZEB2 in the same GA tissue microarrays was inversely related. Restored miR-200a expression inhibited tumor growth in nude mice harboring subcutaneous SGC7901 xenografts. The expression of N-cadherin, Beta-catenin, Twist1 and Snail2 decreased, and E-cadherin levels increased, when miR-200a was elevated, as tested by fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Similar results were observed in vivo. We found upregulated miR-200a expression to increase E-cadherin and suppress the Wnt/Beta-catenin pathway by targeting ZEB1 and ZEB2 in GA, thus delaying tumor growth in vivo. The effect of miR-200a on Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling may provide a therapeutic target against EMT.

23422756	Title	Overexpression of YWHAZ relates to tumor cell proliferation and malignant outcome of gastric carcinoma.
23422756	Abstract	Several studies have demonstrated that YWHAZ (14-3-3Zeta), included in the 14-3-3 family of proteins, has been implicated in the initiation and progression of cancers. We tested whether YWHAZ acted as a cancer-promoting gene through its activation/overexpression in gastric cancer (GC). We analysed 7 GC cell lines and 141 primary tumours, which were curatively resected in our hospital between 2001 and 2003. Overexpression of the YWHAZ protein was frequently detected in GC cell lines (six out of seven lines, 85.7%) and primary tumour samples of GC (72 out of 141 cases, 51%), and significantly correlated with larger tumour size, venous and lymphatic invasion, deeper tumour depth, and higher pathological stage and recurrence rate. Patients with YWHAZ-overexpressing tumours had worse overall survival rates than those with non-expressing tumours in both intensity and proportion expression-dependent manner. YWHAZ positivity was independently associated with a worse outcome in multivariate analysis (P=0.0491, hazard ratio 2.3 (1.003-5.304)). Knockdown of YWHAZ expression using several specific siRNAs inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of YWHAZ-overexpressing GC cells. Higher expression of the YWHAZ protein was significantly associated with the lower expression of miR-375 in primary GC tissues (P=0.0047). These findings suggest that YWHAZ has a pivotal role in tumour cell proliferation through its overexpression, and highlight its usefulness as a prognostic factor and potential therapeutic target in GC.

23430453	Title	A miR-570 binding site polymorphism in the B7-H1 gene is associated with the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma.
23430453	Abstract	Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in putative microRNA (miRNA) target sites (miRSNPs) could affect the binding of miRNA with the target and contribute to the susceptibility of human cancers. However, the role of miRSNPs in gastric cancer susceptibility remains largely unknown. Since the over-expression of B7-H1 protein has been reported to be closely related to disease progression of gastric cancer, we investigated the possible role of miRSNPs at the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of B7-H1 in the risk of developing gastric cancer. In this association study on 205 gastric adenocarcinoma patients and 393 non-cancer controls, we found that the genotype distribution of a common C>G polymorphism (rs4143815) was significantly different between the cases and controls (P = 1.32 * 10(-8)). Compared with CC homozygotes, GG homozygotes and G allele carriers showed 3.73-fold (P = 2.98 * 10(-8)) and 1.85-fold (P = 0.002) increased risk of gastric adenocarcinoma, respectively. Stratified analyses indicated that variant genotypes had a strong association with the clinic-pathological features of gastric cancer including differentiation grade, depth of tumor infiltration, and tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage (P < 0.001). Luciferase reporter assay indicated that this SNP might be responsible for aberrant B7-H1 protein expression in gastric cancer by disrupting the interaction between miR-570 and B7-H1 mRNA. These results are consistent with our hypothesis and indicate that genetic polymorphisms influencing B7-H1 expression modify cancer susceptibility.

23442884	Title	MiR-29c is downregulated in gastric carcinomas and regulates cell proliferation by targeting RCC2.
23442884	Abstract	Previously, using miRNA microarray, we have found that miR-29c is significantly downregulated in advanced gastric carcinoma. In the present study, we investigated whether miR-29c functions as a tumor-suppressor miRNA in gastric carcinoma cells. For this purpose, we verified the downregulation of miR-29c in gastric carcinoma tissues, and assessed the biological effect of miR-29c on gastric carcinoma cells. In miR-29c-transfected cells, both proliferation and colony formation ability on soft agar were significantly decreased. Although apoptosis was not induced, BrdU incorporation and the proportion of cells positive for phospho-histone H3 (S10) were significantly decreased in miR-29c-transfected cells, indicating that miR-29c may be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation. To explain the mechanism of growth suppression by miR-29c, we explored differentially expressed genes (>2-fold) in miR-29c-transfected cells in comparison with negative control transfected cells using microarray. RCC2, PPIC and CDK6 were commonly downregulated in miR-29c-transfected MKN45, MKN7 and MKN74 cells, and all of the genes harbored miR-29c target sequences in the 3'-UTR of their mRNA. RCC2 and PPIC were actually upregulated in gastric carcinoma tissues, and therefore both were identified as possible targets of miR-29c in gastric carcinoma. To ascertain whether downregulation of RCC2 and/or PPIC is involved in the growth suppression by miR-29c, we transfected siRNAs against RCC2 and PPIC into MKN45 and determined cell viability, the rate of BrdU incorporation, and caspase activity. We found that RCC2-knockdown decreased both cell viability and BrdU incorporation without any increase of caspase activity, while PPIC-knockdown did not, indicating that downregulation of RCC2 may be at least partly responsible for the growth suppression by miR-29c. Our findings indicate that miR-29c may have tumor-suppressive functions in gastric carcinoma cells, and that its decreased expression may confer a growth advantage on tumor cells via aberrant expression of RCC2.

23466500	Title	miR-21 confers cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer cells by regulating PTEN.
23466500	Abstract	Resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle for the effective treatment of cancers. The mechanism of chemo-resistance is still poorly understood, however, mounting evidence supports a role for microRNAs (miRNAs) in modulating key cellular pathways mediating response to chemotherapy. microRNA-21 (miR-21) has been implicated in many cancers and contributed to chemo-resistance, but its role in gastric cancer drug resistance still remains unexplored. The aim of this study was to investigate whether miR-21 mediated resistance of the gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin (DDP). Our study found that the expression of miR-21 upregulated in the cisplatin resistant cell line SGC7901/DDP compared to its parental line SGC7901. Moreover, over-expression of miR-21 significantly decreased antiproliferative effects and apoptosis induced by cisplatin, while knockdown of miR-21 dramatically increased antiproliferative effects and apoptosis induction by cisplatin. In addition, miR-21 induced cell survival and cisplatin resistance through downregulating the expression of phosphatase and tension homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) and activation of Akt pathway. Inhibition of Akt using PI3K inhibitor LY 294002 could abrogate miR-21 induced cell survival. These results suggest that miR-21 may provide a novel mechanism for understanding cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer by modulating PTEN/PI3K/Akt pathway.

23479461	Title	In vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity of miR-221/222 inhibitors in multiple myeloma.
23479461	Abstract	A rising body of evidence suggests that silencing microRNAs (miRNAs) with oncogenic potential may represent a successful therapeutic strategy for human cancer. We investigated the therapeutic activity of miR-221/222 inhibitors against human multiple myeloma (MM) cells. Enforced expression of miR-221/222 inhibitors triggered in vitro anti-proliferative effects and up-regulation of canonic miR-221/222 targets, including p27Kip1, PUMA, PTEN and p57Kip2, in MM cells highly expressing miR-221/222. Conversely, transfection of miR-221/222 mimics increased S-phase and down-regulated p27Kip1 protein expression in MM with low basal miR-221/222 levels. The effects of miR-221/222 inhibitors was also evaluated in MM xenografts in SCID/ NOD mice. Significant anti-tumor activity was achieved in xenografted mice by the treatment with miR-221/222 inhibitors, together with up-regulation of canonic protein targets in tumors retrieved from animals. These findings provide proof of principle that silencing the miR-221/222 cluster exerts significant therapeutic activity in MM cells with high miR-221/222 level of expression, which mostly occurs in TC2 and TC4 MM groups. These findings suggest that MM genotyping may predict the therapeutic response. All together our results support a framework for clinical development of miR-221/222 inhibitors-based therapeutic strategy in this still incurable disease.

23479742	Title	CUL4B promotes replication licensing by up-regulating the CDK2-CDC6 cascade.
23479742	Abstract	Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) participate in the regulation of diverse cellular processes including cell cycle progression. Mutations in the X-linked CUL4B, a member of the cullin family, cause mental retardation and other developmental abnormalities in humans. Cells that are deficient in CUL4B are severely selected against in vivo in heterozygotes. Here we report a role of CUL4B in the regulation of replication licensing. Strikingly, CDC6, the licensing factor in replication, was positively regulated by CUL4B and contributed to the loading of MCM2 to chromatin. The positive regulation of CDC6 by CUL4B depends on CDK2, which phosphorylates CDC6, protecting it from APC(CDH1)-mediated degradation. Thus, aside being required for cell cycle reentry from quiescence, CDK2 also contributes to pre-replication complex assembly in G1 phase of cycling cells. Interestingly, the up-regulation of CDK2 by CUL4B is achieved via the repression of miR-372 and miR-373, which target CDK2. Our findings thus establish a CUL4B-CDK2-CDC6 cascade in the regulation of DNA replication licensing.

23482325	Title	Lin28b promotes head and neck cancer progression via modulation of the insulin-like growth factor survival pathway.
23482325	Abstract	Lin28 is a developmentally regulated RNA binding protein which has recently emerged as key regulator in the biogenesis of the let-7 micro-RNA family. While the expression of Lin28b has been linked to advanced tumor stage, the precise molecular mechanism(s) by which Lin28b drives disease progression is still being unraveled. Herein, we generated a let-7-resistant Lin28b ORF, stably expressed in the FaDu head and neck cancer (HNC) cell line. FaDu-Lin28b cells exhibited enhanced tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Global gene and micro-RNA expression analyses revealed significant enrichment in several pathways involved in cell migration, chromatin remodeling, and cellular stress response. Direct regulation of selected genes (HMGA2, CCND2, IGF1R, and IGF2BP2) via a let-7-Lin28b mechanism was validated. Notably, up-regulation of several genes in the IGF pathway in Lin28b-expressing cells was observed. Functional studies revealed significant increase in the survival of Lin28b-expressing cells when cultured under stress conditions, which was dependent on the presence of IGF1. Therefore, our data identified several novel gene targets for Lin28b-let7, and revealed a novel mechanism by which Lin28b promote tumorigenesis. Concordantly, clinical examinations of Lin28b, IGF2BP2 and IGF2 revealed a significant association between the expression of these genes with disease relapse, thereby corroborating the potential relevance for the Lin28b/IGF axis in HNC progression.

23484053	Title	Increased sensitivity to chemotherapy induced by CpG-ODN treatment is mediated by microRNA modulation.
23484053	Abstract	We recently reported that peritumoral CpG-ODN treatment, activating TLR-9 expressing cells in tumor microenvironment, induces modulation of genes involved in DNA repair and sensitizes cancer cells to DNA-damaging cisplatin treatment. Here, we investigated whether this treatment induces modulation of miRNAs in tumor cells and their relevance to chemotherapy response. Array analysis identified 20 differentially expressed miRNAs in human IGROV-1 ovarian tumor cells from CpG-ODN-treated mice versus controls (16 down- and 4 up-regulated). Evaluation of the role of the 3 most differentially expressed miRNAs on sensitivity to cisplatin of IGROV-1 cells revealed significantly increased cisplatin cytotoxicity upon ectopic expression of hsa-miR-302b (up-modulated in our array), but no increased effect upon reduced expression of hsa-miR-424 or hsa-miR-340 (down-modulated in our array). Accordingly, hsa-miR-302b expression was significantly associated with time to relapse or overall survival in two data sets of platinum-treated ovarian cancer patients. Use of bio-informatics tools identified 19 mRNAs potentially targeted by hsa-miR-302b, including HDAC4 gene, which has been reported to mediate cisplatin sensitivity in ovarian cancer. Both HDAC4 mRNA and protein levels were significantly reduced in IGROV-1 cells overexpressing hsa-miR-302b. Altogether, these findings indicate that hsa-miR-302b acts as a "chemosensitizer" in human ovarian carcinoma cells and may represent a biomarker able to predict response to cisplatin treatment. Moreover, the identification of miRNAs that improve sensitivity to chemotherapy provides the experimental underpinning for their possible future clinical use.

23492775	Title	MiR-210 promotes a hypoxic phenotype and increases radioresistance in human lung cancer cell lines.
23492775	Abstract	The resistance of hypoxic cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy is a major problem in the treatment of cancer. Recently, an additional mode of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-dependent transcriptional regulation, involving modulation of a specific set of micro RNAs (miRNAs), including miR-210, has emerged. We have recently shown that HIF-1 induction of miR-210 also stabilizes HIF-1 through a positive regulatory loop. Therefore, we hypothesized that by stabilizing HIF-1 in normoxia, miR-210 may protect cancer cells from radiation. We developed a non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC)-derived cell line (A549) stably expressing miR-210 (pmiR-210) or a control miRNA (pmiR-Ctl). The miR-210-expressing cells showed a significant stabilization of HIF-1 associated with mitochondrial defects and a glycolytic phenotype. Cells were subjected to radiation levels ranging from 0 to 10 Gy in normoxia and hypoxia. Cells expressing miR-210 in normoxia had the same level of radioresistance as control cells in hypoxia. Under hypoxia, pmiR-210 cells showed a low mortality rate owing to a decrease in apoptosis, with an ability to grow even at 10 Gy. This miR-210 phenotype was reproduced in another NSCLC cell line (H1975) and in HeLa cells. We have established that radioresistance was independent of p53 and cell cycle status. In addition, we have shown that genomic double-strand breaks (DSBs) foci disappear faster in pmiR-210 than in pmiR-Ctl cells, suggesting that miR-210 expression promotes a more efficient DSB repair. Finally, HIF-1 invalidation in pmiR-210 cells removed the radioresistant phenotype, showing that this mechanism is dependent on HIF-1. In conclusion, miR-210 appears to be a component of the radioresistance of hypoxic cancer cells. Given the high stability of most miRNAs, this advantage could be used by tumor cells in conditions where reoxygenation has occurred and suggests that strategies targeting miR-210 could enhance tumor radiosensitization.

23496901	Title	The expression level of miR-18b in hepatocellular carcinoma is associated with the grade of malignancy and prognosis.
23496901	Abstract	Many studies support the hypothesis that specific microRNA (miRNA) expression in various human cancers including hepatocarcinogenesis is closely associated with diagnosis and prognosis. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), malignancy level is related to the degree of histological differentiation. In order to establish a novel biomarker that can determine the degree of malignancy and forecast patient prognosis, we performed a microarray analysis to investigate the miRNA expression profiles in 110 HCC which were comprised of 60 moderately, 30 poorly, and 20 well differentiated HCC. We found that the expression of 12 miRNAs varied significantly according to the degree of histological differentiation. Particularly, miR-18b expression in poorly differentiated HCC was significantly higher than in well differentiated HCC. Based on miRanda and Targetscan target search algorithms and Argonaute 2 immunoprecipitation study, we noted that miR-18b can control the expression of trinucleotide repeat containing 6B (TNRC6B) as a target gene. Additionally, in two hepatoma cell lines, we found that over-expression of miR-18b or down-regulation of TNRC6B accelerated cell proliferation and loss of cell adhesion ability. Finally, we observed that after surgical resection, HCC patients with high miR-18b expression had a significantly shorter relapse-free period than those with low expression. miR-18b expression is an important marker of cell proliferation and cell adhesion, and is predictive of clinical outcome. From a clinical point of view, our study emphasizes miR-18b as a diagnostic and prognostic marker for HCC progression.

23497265	Title	A systematic evaluation of miRNA:mRNA interactions involved in the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells.
23497265	Abstract	In this study we performed a systematic evaluation of functional miRNA-mRNA interactions associated with the invasiveness of breast cancer cells using a combination of integrated miRNA and mRNA expression profiling, bioinformatics prediction, and functional assays. Analysis of the miRNA expression identified 11 miRNAs that were differentially expressed, including 7 down-regulated (miR-200c, miR-205, miR-203, miR-141, miR-34a, miR-183, and miR-375) and 4 up-regulated miRNAs (miR-146a, miR-138, miR-125b1 and miR-100), in invasive cell lines when compared to normal and less invasive cell lines. Transfection of miR-200c, miR-205, and miR-375 mimics into MDA-MB-231 cells led to the inhibition of in vitro cell migration and invasion. The integrated analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression identified 35 known and novel target genes of miR-200c, miR-205, and mir-375, including CFL2, LAMC1, TIMP2, ZEB1, CDH11, PRKCA, PTPRJ, PTPRM, LDHB, and SEC23A. Surprisingly, the majority of these genes (27 genes) were target genes of miR-200c, suggesting that miR-200c plays a pivotal role in regulating the invasiveness of breast cancer cells. We characterized one of the target genes of miR-200c, CFL2, and demonstrated that CFL2 is overexpressed in aggressive breast cancer cell lines and can be significantly down-regulated by exogenous miR-200c. Tissue microarray analysis further revealed that CFL2 expression in primary breast cancer tissue correlated with tumor grade. The results obtained from this study may improve our understanding of the role of these candidate miRNAs and their target genes in relation to breast cancer invasiveness and ultimately lead to the identification of novel biomarkers associated with prognosis.

23505378	Title	Estrogen mediated-activation of miR-191/425 cluster modulates tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells depending on estrogen receptor status.
23505378	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs), single-stranded non-coding RNAs, influence myriad biological processes that can contribute to cancer. Although tumor-suppressive and oncogenic functions have been characterized for some miRNAs, the majority of microRNAs have not been investigated for their ability to promote and modulate tumorigenesis. Here, we established that the miR-191/425 cluster is transcriptionally dependent on the host gene, DALRD3, and that the hormone 17Beta-estradiol (estrogen or E2) controls expression of both miR-191/425 and DALRD3. MiR-191/425 locus characterization revealed that the recruitment of estrogen receptor Alpha (ERAlpha) to the regulatory region of the miR-191/425-DALRD3 unit resulted in the accumulation of miR-191 and miR-425 and subsequent decrease in DALRD3 expression levels. We demonstrated that miR-191 protects ERAlpha positive breast cancer cells from hormone starvation-induced apoptosis through the suppression of tumor-suppressor EGR1. Furthermore, enforced expression of the miR-191/425 cluster in aggressive breast cancer cells altered global gene expression profiles and enabled us to identify important tumor promoting genes, including SATB1, CCND2, and FSCN1, as targets of miR-191 and miR-425. Finally, in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that miR-191 and miR-425 reduced proliferation, impaired tumorigenesis and metastasis, and increased expression of epithelial markers in aggressive breast cancer cells. Our data provide compelling evidence for the transcriptional regulation of the miR-191/425 cluster and for its context-specific biological determinants in breast cancers. Importantly, we demonstrated that the miR-191/425 cluster, by reducing the expression of an extensive network of genes, has a fundamental impact on cancer initiation and progression of breast cancer cells.

23509692	Title	miR-1-mediated induction of cardiogenesis in mesenchymal stem cells via downregulation of Hes-1.
23509692	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) have the potential to control stem cells fate decisions. The cardiac- and skeletal-muscle-specific miRNA, miR-1, can regulate embryonic stem cells differentiation to cardiac lineage by suppressing gene expression of alternative lineages. Accordingly, we hypothesized that overexpression of miR-1 may also promote cardiac gene expression in mesenchymal stem cells. Since Notch signaling could inhibit muscle differentiation, a process in contrast with the effect of miR-1, miR-1-mediated repression of Notch signaling may contribute to the observed effects of miR-1 in mesenchymal stem cells. Thus, mesenchymal stem cells were infected by lentiviral vectors carrying miR-1, and cells expressing miR-1 were selected. Alterations in Notch signaling and cardiomyocyte markers, Nkx2.5, GATA-4, cTnT, and CX43, were identified by Western blot in the infected cells on days 1, 7, and 14. Our study showed that the downstream target molecule of Notch pathway, Hes-1, was obviously decreased in mesenchymal stem cells modified with miR-1, and overexpression of miR-1 promotes the specific cardiac gene expression in the infected cells. Knockdown of Hes-1 leads to the same effects on cell lineage decisions. Our results indicated that miR-1 promotes the differentiation of MSCs into cardiac lineage in part due to negative regulation of Hes-1.

23516374	Title	Functional genomic analysis of the let-7 regulatory network in Caenorhabditis elegans.
23516374	Abstract	The let-7 microRNA (miRNA) regulates cellular differentiation across many animal species. Loss of let-7 activity causes abnormal development in Caenorhabditis elegans and unchecked cellular proliferation in human cells, which contributes to tumorigenesis. These defects are due to improper expression of protein-coding genes normally under let-7 regulation. While some direct targets of let-7 have been identified, the genome-wide effect of let-7 insufficiency in a developing animal has not been fully investigated. Here we report the results of molecular and genetic assays aimed at determining the global network of genes regulated by let-7 in C. elegans. By screening for mis-regulated genes that also contribute to let-7 mutant phenotypes, we derived a list of physiologically relevant potential targets of let-7 regulation. Twenty new suppressors of the rupturing vulva or extra seam cell division phenotypes characteristic of let-7 mutants emerged. Three of these genes, opt-2, prmt-1, and T27D12.1, were found to associate with Argonaute in a let-7-dependent manner and are likely novel direct targets of this miRNA. Overall, a complex network of genes with various activities is subject to let-7 regulation to coordinate developmental timing across tissues during worm development.

23516376	Title	Pax6 regulates gene expression in the vertebrate lens through miR-204.
23516376	Abstract	During development, tissue-specific transcription factors regulate both protein-coding and non-coding genes to control differentiation. Recent studies have established a dual role for the transcription factor Pax6 as both an activator and repressor of gene expression in the eye, central nervous system, and pancreas. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory activity of Pax6 is not fully understood. Here, we reveal that Trpm3 and the intronic microRNA gene miR-204 are co-regulated by Pax6 during eye development. miR-204 is probably the best known microRNA to function as a negative modulator of gene expression during eye development in vertebrates. Analysis of genes altered in mouse Pax6 mutants during lens development revealed significant over-representation of miR-204 targets among the genes up-regulated in the Pax6 mutant lens. A number of new targets of miR-204 were revealed, among them Sox11, a member of the SoxC family of pro-neuronal transcription factors, and an important regulator of eye development. Expression of Trpm/miR-204 and a few of its targets are also Pax6-dependent in medaka fish eyes. Collectively, this study identifies a novel evolutionarily conserved mechanism by which Pax6 controls the down-regulation of multiple genes through direct up-regulation of miR-204.

23516523	Title	MiR-181a regulates inflammation responses in monocytes and macrophages.
23516523	Abstract	miR-181a has been presumed to target the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR) of IL1a based on software predictions. miR-181a and IL1a have opposite expression levels in monocytes and macrophages in the inflammatory state. This led us to suspect that mir-181a has an important function in regulating inflammatory response by targeting IL1a. Fluorescence reporter assays showed that miR-181a effectively binds to the 3'-UTR of IL1a. The anti-inflammatory functions of miR-181a were investigated in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced Raw264.7 and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/LPS-induced THP-1 cells. We found that miR-181a mimics significantly lowered IL1a expression levels in these cells and, interestingly, miR-181a inhibitors reversed this decrease. In addition, miR-181a mimics significantly inhibited increase in the levels of inflammatory factors (IL1b, IL6, and TNFa) in these cells. Furthermore, miR-181a mimics and inhibitors decreased and increased, respectively, production of reactive oxygen species in PMA/LPS-induced THP-1 cells. These results indicate that miR-181a regulates inflammatory responses by directly targeting the 3'-UTR of IL1a and down-regulating IL1a levels. Interestingly, we found that miR-181a inhibited production of inflammatory factors even in IL1a-induced THP-1 cells, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory effects of miR-181a possibly involves other targets in addition to IL1a. Thus, we provide the first evidence for anti-inflammatory effects of miR-181a mediated at least in part by down-regulating IL1a.

23517578	Title	Dynamically expressed microRNA-15b modulates the activities of CD8+ T lymphocytes in mice with Lewis lung carcinoma.
23517578	Abstract	CD8+ T cells are key members of adaptive immunity against tumorigenesis. As subset of CD8+ T cells, effector T cells (Te) and memory T cells (Tm) have different biological activities. The former can kill tumor cells but come into apoptosis in a certain period and the latter is static with the ability of self-renewal. Previous studies showed that microRNAs (miRNA) played critical roles in regulating adaptive immunity. This study aimed to identify the different expression of miRNAs between Te and Tm cells in tumor-bearing mice and to sort out the target miRNAs which can be regulated to improve anti-tumor activities of CD8+ T cells. miRNA expression profiling was performed on CD8+ Te and Tm cells from mice with Lewis lung carcinoma. Differentially expressed miRNA (miRNA-15b) was chosen and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Then, flow cytometry, ELISA, and CFSE kit were used to evaluate the biological effects of miRNA-15b on apoptosis, cytokine secretion, phenotype, and proliferation of CD8+ T cell. The possible downstream target genes of this miRNA were also analyzed. Analysis of miRNA microarray and qRT-PCR showed that the level of miRNA-15b was higher in CD8+ Tm cells than in Te cells. Higher expression of miRNA-15b was observed in CD8+ T cells from tumor-bearing mice than those from healthy ones. Transfection of CD8+ T cells with miRNA-15b mimics could prevent T cells from apoptosis by inhibiting the translation of DEDD (Death Effector Domain-containing DNA binding protein). Moreover, ectopic miRNA-15b could inhibit the activation of CD8+ T cells (via repressing the production of IL-2 and IFN-Gamma and expression of CD69) and promote expression of CD44 through unknown pathways. Up-regulation of miRNA-15b in tumor environment might negatively regulate anti-tumor immunity through inhibiting function of CD8+ T cells. miRNA-15b might be a potential therapeutic target for immunotherapy.

23519125	Title	Functional cooperation of miR-125a, miR-125b, and miR-205 in entinostat-induced downregulation of erbB2/erbB3 and apoptosis in breast cancer cells.
23519125	Abstract	We reported that the class I HDAC inhibitor entinostat induced apoptosis in erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells via downregulation of erbB2 and erbB3. Here, we study the molecular mechanism by which entinostat dual-targets erbB2/erbB3. Treatment with entinostat had no effect on erbB2/erbB3 mRNA, suggesting a transcription-independent mechanism. Entinostat decreased endogenous but not exogenous erbB2/erbB3, indicating it did not alter their protein stability. We hypothesized that entinostat might inhibit erbB2/erbB3 protein translation via specific miRNAs. Indeed, entinostat significantly upregulated miR-125a, miR-125b, and miR-205, that have been reported to target erbB2 and/or erbB3. Specific inhibitors were then used to determine whether these miRNAs had a causal role in entinostat-induced downregulation of erbB2/erbB3 and apoptosis. Transfection with a single inhibitor dramatically abrogated entinostat induction of miR-125a, miR-125b, or miR-205; however, none of the inhibitors blocked entinostat action on erbB2/erbB3. In contrast, co-transfection with two inhibitors not only reduced their corresponding miRNAs, but also significantly abrogated entinostat-mediated reduction of erbB2/erbB3. Moreover, simultaneous inhibition of two, but not one miRNA significantly attenuated entinostat-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, although the other HDAC inhibitors, such as SAHA and panobinostat, exhibited activity as potent as entinostat to induce growth inhibition and apoptosis in erbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, they had no significant effects on the three miRNAs. Instead, both SAHA- and panobinostat-decreased erbB2/erbB3 expression correlated with the reduction of their mRNA levels. Collectively, we demonstrate that entinostat specifically induces expression of miR-125a, miR-125b, and miR-205, which act in concert to downregulate erbB2/erbB3 in breast cancer cells. Our data suggest that epigenetic regulation via miRNA-dependent or -independent mechanisms may represent a novel approach to treat breast cancer patients with erbB2-overexpressing tumors.

23519249	Title	MicroRNA miR-491-5p targeting both TP53 and Bcl-XL induces cell apoptosis in SW1990 pancreatic cancer cells through mitochondria mediated pathway.
23519249	Abstract	MicroRNA (miRNA) actively participates in a broad range of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, cell survival and apoptosis. Deregulated expression of miRNA may affect cell growth and eventually lead to cancer. In this study, we found that hsa-miR491-5p (miR491-5p) displays a significantly high level of expression in normal human pancreas tissue versus pancreatic cancer cells. Targeted site prediction indicated that both Bcl-XL and TP53 contain miR-491-5p recognizing sites in their 3' UTRs. Overexpression of miR-491-5p in the pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990 effectively inhibited both endogenous Bcl-XL and TP53 gene expressions. Mutagenesis at the seed match region of both targeted genes further confirmed the specificity of miR491-5p recognition. Cell proliferation rate was inversely related to the increased doses of miR-491-5p. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the proportions of total apoptotic and early apoptotic cells were significantly induced as the dose of miR491-5p increased. Moreover, a mechanistic study indicated that miR-R491-5p-mediated cell apoptosis was associated with the activation of intrinsic mitochondria mediated pathways. miR491-5p also markedly inhibited mitogenic signaling pathways such as STAT3 and PI-3K/Akt, but not Ras/MAPK. Thus, our results demonstrated that miR491-5p could effectively target both Bcl-xL and TP53 and induce cell apoptosis independent of TP53.

23527086	Title	XB130, a new adaptor protein, regulates expression of tumor suppressive microRNAs in cancer cells.
23527086	Abstract	XB130, a novel adaptor protein, promotes cell growth by controlling expression of many related genes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which are frequently mis-expressed in cancer cells, regulate expression of targeted genes. In this present study, we aimed to explore the oncogenic mechanism of XB130 through miRNAs regulation. We analyzed miRNA expression in XB130 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) stably transfected WRO thyroid cancer cells by a miRNA array assay, and 16 miRNAs were up-regulated and 22 miRNAs were down-regulated significantly in these cells, in comparison with non-transfected or negative control shRNA transfected cells. We chose three of the up-regulated miRNAs (miR-33a, miR-149 and miR-193a-3p) and validated them by real-time qRT-PCR. Ectopic overexpression of XB130 suppressed these 3 miRNAs in MRO cells, a cell line with very low expression of XB130. Furthermore, we transfected miR mimics of these 3 miRNAs into WRO cells. They negatively regulated expression of oncogenes (miR-33a: MYC, miR-149: FOSL1, miR-193a-3p: SLC7A5), by targeting their 3' untranslated region, and reduced cell growth. Our results suggest that XB130 could promote growth of cancer cells by regulating expression of tumor suppressive miRNAs and their targeted genes.

23548312	Title	Mesenchymal stem cells deliver synthetic microRNA mimics to glioma cells and glioma stem cells and inhibit their cell migration and self-renewal.
23548312	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as potential cancer therapeutics; however, their clinical use is hindered by lack of effective delivery mechanisms to tumor sites. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to migrate to experimental glioma and to exert anti-tumor effects by delivering cytotoxic compounds. Here, we examined the ability of MSCs derived from bone marrow, adipose tissue, placenta and umbilical cord to deliver synthetic miRNA mimics to glioma cells and glioma stem cells (GSCs). We examined the delivery of miR-124 and miR-145 mimics as glioma cells and GSCs express very low levels of these miRNAs. Using fluorescently labeled miRNA mimics and in situ hybridization, we demonstrated that all the MSCs examined delivered miR-124 and miR-145 mimics to co-cultured glioma cells and GSCs via gap junction- dependent and independent processes. The delivered miR-124 and miR-145 mimics significantly decreased the luciferase activity of their respected reporter target genes, SCP-1 and Sox2, and decreased the migration of glioma cells and the self-renewal of GSCs. Moreover, MSCs delivered Cy3-miR-124 mimic to glioma xenografts when administered intracranially. These results suggest that MSCs can deliver synthetic exogenous miRNA mimics to glioma cells and GSCs and may provide an efficient route of therapeutic miRNA delivery in vivo.

23549984	Title	MicroRNA-148a can regulate runt-related transcription factor 3 gene expression via modulation of DNA methyltransferase 1 in gastric cancer.
23549984	Abstract	Underexpression of the gene runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3), an important tumor suppressor, is known to contribute to gastric cancer progression. However, the mechanism underlying aberrant RUNX3 expression has not been fully elucidated. We investigated the role of microRNA-148a (miR-148a) and DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in RUNX3 promoter methylation and gene expression. RUNX3 mRNA, RUNX3 protein, and methylation levels were assayed in human gastric cancer tissues and matched normal tissues, and AGS and BGC-823 cells by real-time reverse transcription PCR, Western blot, and methylation-specific PCR, respectively. A correlation between RUNX3 mRNA levels and that of miR-148a was also investigated in gastric cancer tissues. We found that RUNX3 mRNA levels were significantly downregulated in gastric cancer tissues compared with their matched normal tissues, and were closely associated with miR-148a expression. After treatment of human gastric cancer AGS and BGC-823 cells with the DNA methylation inhibitor 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, a significant increase in RUNX3 mRNA, RUNX3 protein, and the non-methylated form of the RUNX3 promoter were observed relative to untreated cells. Enforced expression of miR-148a, which can modulate DNMT1 and DNMT3B, also increased the expression of RUNX3 in gastric cancer cells. Knockdown of DNMT1 was associated with increased levels of RUNX3 mRNA and RUNX3 protein, while knockdown of DNMT3B did not have any effect on these in BGC-823 cells. Our results show that miR-148a may regulate RUNX3 expression through modulation of DNMT1-dependent DNA methylation in gastric cancer and highlight a miRNA-epigenetics regulation mechanism of gene expression.

23552692	Title	Tumor suppressor miR-375 regulates MYC expression via repression of CIP2A coding sequence through multiple miRNA-mRNA interactions.
23552692	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs involved in posttranscriptional regulation of protein-coding genes in various biological processes. In our preliminary miRNA microarray analysis, miR-375 was identified as the most underexpressed in human oral tumor versus controls. The purpose of the present study is to examine the function of miR-375 as a candidate tumor suppressor miRNA in oral cancer. Cancerous inhibitor of PP2A (CIP2A), a guardian of oncoprotein MYC, is identified as a candidate miR-375 target based on bioinformatics. Luciferase assay accompanied by target sequence mutagenesis elucidates five functional miR-375-binding sites clustered in the CIP2A coding sequence close to the C-terminal domain. Overexpression of CIP2A is clearly demonstrated in oral cancers, and inverse correlation between miR-375 and CIP2A is observed in the tumors, as well as in NCI-60 cell lines, indicating the potential generalized involvement of the miR-375-CIP2A relationship in many other cancers. Transient transfection of miR-375 in oral cancer cells reduces the expression of CIP2A, resulting in decrease of MYC protein levels and leading to reduced proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion. Therefore this study shows that underexpression of tumor suppressor miR-375 could lead to uncontrolled CIP2A expression and extended stability of MYC, which contributes to promoting cancerous phenotypes.

23553990	Title	MiR-23a in amplified 19p13.13 loci targets metallothionein 2A and promotes growth in gastric cancer cells.
23553990	Abstract	Copy number variation (CNV) and abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) always lead to deregulation of genes in cancer, including gastric cancer (GC). However, little is known about how CNVs affect the expression of miRNAs. By integrating CNV and miRNA profiles in the same samples, we identified eight miRNAs (miR-1274a, miR-196b, miR-4298, miR-181c, miR-181d, miR-23a, miR-27a and miR-24-2) that were located in the amplified regions and were upregulated in GC. In particular, amplification of miR-23a-27a-24-2 cluster and miR-181c-181d cluster frequently occurred at 19p13.13 and were confirmed by genomic real-time PCR in another 25 paired GC samples. Moreover, in situ hybridization (ISH) experiments represented that mature miR-23a was increased in GCs (75.5%, 40/53) compared with matched normal tissues (28.6%, 14/49, P = 0.001). Knocking down of miR-23a expression inhibited BGC823 cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the potential target genes of miR-23a were investigated by integration of mRNA profile and miRNA TargetScan predictions, we found that upregulation of miR-23a and downregulation of metallothionein 2A (MT2A) were detected simultaneously in 70% (7/10) of the miRNA and mRNA profiles. Furthermore, an inverse correlation between miR-23a and MT2A expression was detected in GCs and normal tissues. Through combining luciferase assay, we confirmed that MT2A is a potential target of miR-23a. In conclusion, these results suggest that integration of CNV-miRNA-mRNA profiling is a powerful tool for identifying molecular signatures, and that miR-23a might play a role in regulating MT2A expression in GC.

23554686	Title	MiR-148a inhibits angiogenesis by targeting ERBB3.
23554686	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in carcinogenesis in various solid cancers including breast cancer. Down-regulation of microRNA-148a (miR-148a) has been reported in certain cancer types. However, the biological role of miR-148a and its related targets in breast cancer are unknown yet. In this study, we showed that the level of miR-148a was lower in MCF7 cells than that in MCF10A cells. V-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (ERBB3) is a direct target of miR-148a in human breast cancer cells through direct binding of miR-148a to ERBB3 3'-UTR region. Overexpression of miR-148a in MCF7 cells inhibited ERBB3 expression, blocked the downstream pathway activation including activation of AKT, ERK1/2, and p70S6K1, and decreased HIF-1Alpha expression. Furthermore, forced expression of miR-148a attenuated tumor angiogenesis in vivo. Our results identify ERBB3 as a direct target of miR-148a, and provide direct evidence that miR-148a inhibits tumor angiogenesis through ERBB3 and its downstream signaling molecules. This information would be helpful for targeting the miR-148a/ERBB3 pathway for breast cancer prevention and treatment in the future.

23554909	Title	Restoration of miR-1228* expression suppresses epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gastric cancer.
23554909	Abstract	Dysregulated miRNAs play critical roles during carcinogenesis and cancer progression. In the present study, the function of miR-1228* in regulating cancer progression was investigated in gastric cancer. Decreased expression of miR-1228* was observed in human gastric cancer tissues comparing to normal tissues. Subsequently, the role of miR-1228* was evaluated in vivo using the tumor xenograft model. In this model, miR-1228* overexpression suppressed xenograft tumor formation. Furthermore, we demonstrated miR-1228* negatively regulated NF-KappaB activity in SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells and found that CK2A2 was a target of miR-1228*. Upregulation of miR-1228* decreased the expression of mesenchymal markers and increased the epithelial marker E-cadherin, suggesting its potential role in suppressing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Collectively, these findings provide the first evidence that miR-1228* plays an important role in regulating gastric cancer growth and suggest that selective restoration of miR-1228* might be beneficial for gastric cancer therapy.

23554959	Title	Genistein up-regulates tumor suppressor microRNA-574-3p in prostate cancer.
23554959	Abstract	Genistein has been shown to inhibit cancers both in vitro and in vivo, by altering the expression of several microRNAs (miRNAs). In this study, we focused on tumor suppressor miRNAs regulated by genistein and investigated their function in prostate cancer (PCa) and target pathways. Using miRNA microarray analysis and real-time RT-PCR we observed that miR-574-3p was significantly up-regulated in PCa cells treated with genistein compared with vehicle control. The expression of miR-574-3p was significantly lower in PCa cell lines and clinical PCa tissues compared with normal prostate cells (RWPE-1) and adjacent normal tissues. Low expression level of miR-574-3p was correlated with advanced tumor stage and higher Gleason score in PCa specimens. Re-expression of miR-574-3p in PCa cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. miR-574-3p restoration induced apoptosis through reducing Bcl-xL and activating caspase-9 and caspase-3. Using GeneCodis software analysis, several pathways affected by miR-574-3p were identified, such as 'Pathways in cancer', 'Jak-STAT signaling pathway', and 'Wnt signaling pathway'. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-574-3p directly binds to the 3' UTR of several target genes (such as RAC1, EGFR and EP300) that are components of 'Pathways in cancer'. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western analysis showed that the mRNA and protein expression levels of the three target genes in PCa cells were markedly down-regulated with miR-574-3p. Loss-of-function studies demonstrated that the three target genes significantly affect cell proliferation, migration and invasion in PCa cell lines. Our results show that genistein up-regulates tumor suppressor miR-574-3p expression targeting several cell signaling pathways. These findings enhance understanding of how genistein regulates with miRNA in PCa.

23555702	Title	Boron stress responsive microRNAs and their targets in barley.
23555702	Abstract	Boron stress is an environmental factor affecting plant development and production. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to be involved in several plant processes such as growth regulation and stress responses. In this study, miRNAs associated with boron stress were identified and characterized in barley. miRNA profiles were also comparatively analyzed between root and leave samples. A total of 31 known and 3 new miRNAs were identified in barley; 25 of them were found to respond to boron treatment. Several miRNAs were expressed in a tissue specific manner; for example, miR156d, miR171a, miR397, and miR444a were only detected in leaves. Additionally, a total of 934 barley transcripts were found to be specifically targeted and degraded by miRNAs. In silico analysis of miRNA target genes demonstrated that many miRNA targets are conserved transcription factors such as Squamosa promoter-binding protein, Auxin response factor (ARF), and the MYB transcription factor family. A majority of these targets were responsible for plant growth and response to environmental changes. We also propose that some of the miRNAs in barley such as miRNA408 might play critical roles against boron exposure. In conclusion, barley may use several pathways and cellular processes targeted by miRNAs to cope with boron stress. 

23555954	Title	miR-146a inhibits cell growth, cell migration and induces apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer cells.
23555954	Abstract	Aberrant expression of microRNA-146a (miR-146a) has been reported to be involved in the development and progression of various types of cancers. However, its role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of miR-146a to various aspects of the malignant phenotype of human NSCLCs. In functional experiments, miR-146a suppressed cell growth, induced cellular apoptosis and inhibited EGFR downstream signaling in five NSCLC cell lines (H358, H1650, H1975, HCC827 and H292). miR-146a also inhibited the migratory capacity of these NSCLC cells. On the other hand, miR-146a enhanced the inhibition of cell proliferation by drugs targeting EGFR, including both TKIs (gefitinib, erlotinib, and afatinib) and a monoclonal antibody (cetuximab). These effects were independent of the EGFR mutation status (wild type, sensitizing mutation or resistance mutation), but were less potent compared to the effects of siRNA targeting of EGFR. Our results suggest that these effects of miR-146a are due to its targeting of EGFR and NF-KappaB signaling. We also found, in clinical formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) lung cancer samples, that low expression of miR-146a was correlated with advanced clinical TNM stages and distant metastasis in NSCLC (P<0.05). The patients with high miR-146a expression in their tumors showed longer progression-free survival (25.6 weeks in miR-146a high patients vs. 4.8 weeks in miR-146a low patients, P<0.05). miR-146a is therefore a strong candidate prognostic biomarker in NSCLC. Thus inducing miR-146a might be a therapeutic strategy for NSCLC.

23557329	Title	Identification of microRNA-mRNA functional interactions in UVB-induced senescence of human diploid fibroblasts.
23557329	Abstract	Cellular senescence can be induced by a variety of extrinsic stimuli, and sustained exposure to sunlight is a key factor in photoaging of the skin. Accordingly, irradiation of skin fibroblasts by UVB light triggers cellular senescence, which is thought to contribute to extrinsic skin aging, although molecular mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we addressed molecular mechanisms underlying UVB induced senescence of human diploid fibroblasts. We observed a parallel activation of the p53/p21(WAF1) and p16(INK4a)/pRb pathways. Using genome-wide transcriptome analysis, we identified a transcriptional signature of UVB-induced senescence that was conserved in three independent strains of human diploid fibroblasts (HDF) from skin. In parallel, a comprehensive screen for microRNAs regulated during UVB-induced senescence was performed which identified five microRNAs that are significantly regulated during the process. Bioinformatic analysis of miRNA-mRNA networks was performed to identify new functional mRNA targets with high confidence for miR-15a, miR-20a, miR-20b, miR-93, and miR-101. Already known targets of these miRNAs were identified in each case, validating the approach. Several new targets were identified for all of these miRNAs, with the potential to provide new insight in the process of UVB-induced senescence at a genome-wide level. Subsequent analysis was focused on miR-101 and its putative target gene Ezh2. We confirmed that Ezh2 is regulated by miR-101 in human fibroblasts, and found that both overexpression of miR-101 and downregulation of Ezh2 independently induce senescence in the absence of UVB irradiation. However, the downregulation of miR-101 was not sufficient to block the phenotype of UVB-induced senescence, suggesting that other UVB-induced processes induce the senescence response in a pathway redundant with upregulation of miR-101. We performed a comprehensive screen for UVB-regulated microRNAs in human diploid fibroblasts, and identified a network of miRNA-mRNA interactions mediating UVB-induced senescence.

23569431	Title	MicroRNA-34a inhibits human osteosarcoma proliferation by downregulating ether à go-go 1 expression.
23569431	Abstract	Aberrant expression of MicroRNAs (miRNAs) has been implicated in several types of cancer. As a direct target gene of p53, miR-34a has been suggested to mediate the tumor suppressor function of p53. Ether à go-go 1 (Eag1) channel is overexpressed in a variety of cancers and plays important roles in cancer progression. However, the link between miR-34a and Eag1 in cancer is unclear. In this study, we used human osteosarcoma as the model to demonstrate that miR-34a was significantly downregulated in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines compared with normal brain tissues and osteoblastic cell line. Next we evaluated the role of miR-34a in the regulation of osteosarcoma cell proliferation by CCK-8 and colony formation assays. The results showed that overexpression of miR-34a inhibited the proliferation of MG-63 and Saos-2 cells. Furthermore, xenograft nude mice model showed that miR-34a inhibited osteosarcoma growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that overexpression of miR-34a led to decreased Eag1 expression in osteosarcoma cells while inhibition of miR-34a increased Eag1 expression. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-34a could inhibit osteosarcoma growth via the down regulation of Eag1 expression.

23571738	Title	miR-205 negatively regulates the androgen receptor and is associated with adverse outcome of prostate cancer patients.
23571738	Abstract	The microRNA-205 (miR-205) has been shown to be deregulated in prostate cancer (PCa). Here we continue to investigate the prognostic and therapeutic potential of this microRNA. The expression of miR-205 is measured by qRT-PCR and in situ hybridisation in a well-documented PCa cohort. An AGO2-based RIP-Chip assay is used to identify targets that are verified with western blots, luciferase reporter assay, ELISA and immunohistochemistry. The expression of miR-205 is inversely correlated to the occurrence of metastases and shortened overall survival, and is lower in castration-resistant PCa patients. The miR-205 expression is mainly localised to the basal cells of benign prostate tissues. Genes regulated by miR-205 are enriched in, for example, the MAPK/ERK, Toll-like receptor and IL-6 signaling pathways. We demonstrate binding of miR-205 to the 3'UTR of androgen receptor (AR) and decrease of both AR transcript and protein levels. This finding was corroborated in the patient cohort were miR-205 expression inversely correlated to AR immunostaining in malignant prostate cells and to serum levels of prostate-specific antigen, an androgen-regulated protein. Taken together, these findings imply that miR-205 might have therapeutic potential, especially for the castration resistant and currently untreatable form of PCa.

23576572	Title	FoxM1 is overexpressed in Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinogenesis and is negatively regulated by miR-370.
23576572	Abstract	Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infections are strongly implicated in human gastric mucosa-associated diseases. Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1), a key positive regulator of cell proliferation, is overexpressed in gastric cancer. MicroRNAs are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. In this study, the effects of H. pylori infection on FoxM1 expression and possible mechanisms of carcinogenesis were explored. The expression of FoxM1 was gradually increased in human gastric specimens from inflammation to cancer. FoxM1 upregulation was time- and concentration-dependent in gastric epithelial-derived cell lines infected with H. pylori. CagA, a key virulence factor of H. pylori, was associated with increased FoxM1 expression. H. pylori and CagA inhibited the expression of p27(Kip1) (CDKN1B) and promoted cell proliferation by upregulating FoxM1. The expression of miR-370 was decreased in human gastritis and gastric cancer. FoxM1 was directly downregulated by miR-370 in gastric cell lines. H. pylori and CagA inhibited miR-370 expression, which led to overexpression of FoxM1 and cell proliferation. Furthermore, the overexpression of FoxM1 and reduced expression of miR-370 was confirmed in H. pylori-infected C57BL/6J mice. H. pylori infection and CagA upregulated FoxM1 expression, dependent on miR-370, altered the expression of p27(Kip1), and promoted proliferation in gastric cells. These findings delineate the mechanisms governing FoxM1 regulation and the role of H. pylori in the process of gastric carcinogenesis.

23577178	Title	Functional profiling of precursor MicroRNAs identifies MicroRNAs essential for glioma proliferation.
23577178	Abstract	Cancer initiation and progression involve microRNAs that can function like tumor suppressors and oncogenes. The functional significance of most miRNAs is currently unknown. To determine systematically which microRNAs are essential for glioma growth, we screened a precursor microRNA library in three human glioblastoma and one astroglial cell line model systems. The most prominent and consistent cell proliferation-reducing hits were validated in secondary screening with an additional apoptosis endpoint. The functional screening data were integrated in the miRNA expression data to find underexpressed true functional tumor suppressor miRNAs. In addition, we used miRNA-target gene predictions and combined siRNA functional screening data to find the most probable miRNA-target gene pairs with a similar functional effect on proliferation. Nine novel functional miRNAs (hsa-miR-129, -136, -145, -155, -181b, -342-5p, -342-3p, -376a/b) in GBM cell lines were validated for their importance in glioma cell growth, and similar effects for six target genes (ROCK1, RHOA, MET, CSF1R, EIF2AK1, FGF7) of these miRNAs were shown functionally. The clinical significance of the functional hits was validated in miRNA expression data from the TCGA glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumor cohort. Five tumor suppressor miRNAs (hsa-miR-136, -145, -342, -129, -376a) showed significant underexpression in clinical GBM tumor samples from the TCGA GBM cohort further supporting the role of these miRNAs in vivo. Most importantly, higher hsa-miR-145 expression in GBM tumors yielded significantly better survival (p<0.005) in a subset of patients thus validating it as a genuine tumor suppressor miRNA. This systematic functional profiling provides important new knowledge about functionally relevant miRNAs in GBM biology and may offer new targets for treating glioma.

23577194	Title	Hepatitis C virus core protein down-regulates p21(Waf1/Cip1) and inhibits curcumin-induced apoptosis through microRNA-345 targeting in human hepatoma cells.
23577194	Abstract	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been reported to regulate cellular microRNAs. The HCV core protein is considered to be a potential oncoprotein in HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma, but HCV core-modulated cellular microRNAs are unknown. The HCV core protein regulates p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression. However, the mechanism of HCV core-associated p21(Waf1/Cip1) regulation remains to be further clarified. Therefore, we attempted to determine whether HCV core-modulated cellular microRNAs play an important role in regulating p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression in human hepatoma cells. Cellular microRNA profiling was investigated in core-overexpressing hepatoma cells using TaqMan low density array. Array data were further confirmed by TaqMan real-time qPCR for single microRNA in core-overexpressing and full-length HCV replicon-expressing cells. The target gene of microRNA was examined by reporter assay. The gene expression was determined by real-time qPCR and Western blotting. Apoptosis was examined by annexin V-FITC apoptosis assay. Cell cycle analysis was performed by propidium iodide staining. Cell proliferation was analyzed by MTT assay. HCV core protein up- or down-regulated some cellular microRNAs in Huh7 cells. HCV core-induced microRNA-345 suppressed p21(Waf1/Cip1) gene expression through targeting its 3' untranslated region in human hepatoma cells. Moreover, the core protein inhibited curcumin-induced apoptosis through p21(Waf1/Cip1)-targeting microRNA-345 in Huh7 cells. HCV core protein enhances the expression of microRNA-345 which then down-regulates p21(Waf1/Cip1) expression. It is the first time that HCV core protein has ever been shown to suppress p21(Waf1/Cip1) gene expression through miR-345 targeting.

23579275	Title	Reactive oxygen species-responsive miR-210 regulates proliferation and migration of adipose-derived stem cells via PTPN2.
23579275	Abstract	Hypoxia enhances the proliferation and migration of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) via the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, this study primarily investigated whether or not ROS generation could regulate microRNA-210 (miR-210) expression, and increase proliferation/migration of ASCs. In addition, we tried to identify the signaling pathways involved in miR-210 upregulation and the direct target genes of miR-210 that mediate these functions. Various sources of ROS generation such as hypoxia, antimycin, rotenone, and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB upregulated miR-210 expression, and increased the proliferation/migration of ASCs. There is a positive feed-forward loop between ROS generation and miR-210, and miR-210 itself increases ROS generation by downregulation of iron-sulfur cluster scaffold homolog 2 (ISCU2). Although hypoxia-inducible factor-1Alpha was not involved in miR-210 expression, pharmacological or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-driven inhibition of Akt and ERK1/2 molecules reduced miR-210 expression. Transfection of siRNAs of NF-KappaB and Elk1 also reduced miR-210 expression, indicating that these signaling pathways mediate miR-210 upregulation. Protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 2 (PTPN2) was selected for miR-210 target gene, and it was downregulated by ROS generators or miR-210 mimic treatment. PTPN2 was first proven to be a direct miR-210 target in luciferase activity assay, and pharmacological inhibition or overexpression of PTPN2 regulated the proliferation and migration of ASC. In conclusion, ROS generation from diverse sources induces miR-210 expression in ASCs via PDGFR-Beta, Akt and ERK pathways. Transcription of miR-210 expression is regulated by NF-KappaB and Elk1, and miR-210 increases the proliferation and migration of ASCs via ISCU2 and PTPN2 downregulation.

23584479	Title	Gain-of-function mutant p53 downregulates miR-223 contributing to chemoresistance of cultured tumor cells.
23584479	Abstract	Mutant p53 proteins are expressed at high frequency in human tumors and are associated with poor clinical prognosis and resistance to chemotherapeutic treatments. Here we show that mutant p53 proteins downregulate micro-RNA (miR)-223 expression in breast and colon cancer cell lines. Mutant p53 binds the miR-223 promoter and reduces its transcriptional activity. This requires the transcriptional repressor ZEB-1. We found that miR-223 exogenous expression sensitizes breast and colon cancer cell lines expressing mutant p53 to treatment with DNA-damaging drugs. Among the putative miR-223 targets, we focused on stathmin-1 (STMN-1), an oncoprotein known to confer resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs associated with poor clinical prognosis. Mutant p53 silencing or miR-223 exogenous expression lowers the levels of STMN-1 and knockdown of STMN-1 by small interfering RNA increases cell death of mutant p53-expressing cell lines. On the basis of these findings, we propose that one of the pathways affected by mutant p53 to increase cellular resistance to chemotherapeutic agents involves miR-223 downregulation and the consequent upregulation of STMN-1.

23584484	Title	miR-194 suppresses metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer through regulating expression of BMP1 and p27(kip1).
23584484	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are increasingly implicated in regulating tumor malignance through their capacity to coordinately repress expression of tumor-related genes. Here, we show that overexpression of miR-194 in lung cancer cell lines, results in suppressing metastasis of lung cancer cells, while inhibiting its expression through 'miRNA sponge' promotes the cancer cells to metastasize. miR-194 expression is also found to be in strongly negative association with metastasis in clinical specimens of non-small cell lung cancer. We demonstrate that miR-194 directly targets both BMP1 and p27(kip1). The resulting downregulation of BMP1 leads to suppression of TGFBeta activity and, thus, to downregulation of the expression of key oncogenic genes (matrix metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP9). This leads, in turn, to decreased tumor invasion. In addition, the miRNA-194-induced suppression of p27(kip1) activates the RhoA pathway, producing enhanced development of actin stress fibers and impaired migration of cancer cells. These findings reveal two structurally independent but functionally linked branches of the regulatory and signaling pathway that together provide a bridge between the metastasis-depressing miRNA and the key genes that govern the malignancy of lung cancers.

23585871	Title	Oncomir miR-125b suppresses p14(ARF) to modulate p53-dependent and p53-independent apoptosis in prostate cancer.
23585871	Abstract	MicroRNAs are a class of naturally occurring small non-coding RNAs that target protein-coding mRNAs at the post-transcriptional level and regulate complex patterns of gene expression. Our previous studies demonstrated that in human prostate cancer the miRNA miR-125b is highly expressed, leading to a negative regulation of some tumor suppressor genes. In this study, we further extend our studies by showing that miR-125b represses the protein product of the ink4a/ARF locus, p14(ARF), in two prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP (wild type-p53) and 22Rv1 (both wild type and mutant p53), as well as in the PC-346C prostate cancer xenograft model that lentivirally overexpressed miR-125b. Our results highlight that miR-125b modulates the p53 network by hindering the down-regulation of Mdm2, thereby affecting p53 and its target genes p21 and Puma to a degree sufficient to inhibit apoptosis. Conversely, treatment of prostate cancer cells with an inhibitor of miR-125b (anti-miR-125b) resulted in increased expression of p14(ARF), decreased level of Mdm2, and induction of apoptosis. In addition, overexpression of miR-125b in p53-deficient PC3 cells induced down-regulation of p14(ARF), which leads to increased cell proliferation through a p53-independent manner. Thus, we conclude that miR-125b acts as an oncogene which regulates p14(ARF)/Mdm2 signaling, stimulating proliferation of prostate cancer cells through a p53-dependent or p53-independent function. This reinforces our belief that miR-125b has potential as a therapeutic target for the management of patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

23591197	Title	MicroRNA-125b regulates proliferation and radioresistance of oral squamous cell carcinoma.
23591197	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in essential biological activities, and have been reported to exhibit differential expression profiles in various cancers. Our previous study demonstrated that intercellular adhesion molecule-2 (ICAM2) inhibition induces radiosensitisation in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. Thus, we hypothesised that certain miRNAs play crucial roles in radioresistance in OSCC by regulating ICAM2 expression. Because predicted target gene analyses revealed that microRNA-125b (miR-125b) potentially regulates ICAM2 mRNA expression, we examined the association between miR-125b and radioresistance. The expression of miR-125b was investigated by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. For a functional analysis, miR-125b was transfected to OSCC-derived cells. A downregulated expression of miR-125b was found in OSCC-derived cell lines and OSCC samples. The miR-125b-transfected cells showed a decreased proliferation rate, enhanced radiosensitivity to X-ray irradiation and diminished ICAM2 mRNA expression. Moreover, miR-125b expression correlated with OSCC tumour staging and survival. These findings suggested that the downregulated miR-125b expression was associated with proliferation and radioresistance mechanisms, probably through ICAM2 signalling. Thus, controlling the expression or activity of miR-125b might contribute to suppressing proliferation and overcoming radioresistance in OSCC.

23593016	Title	Iron-responsive miR-485-3p regulates cellular iron homeostasis by targeting ferroportin.
23593016	Abstract	Ferroportin (FPN) is the only known cellular iron exporter in mammalian cells and plays a critical role in the maintenance of both cellular and systemic iron balance. During iron deprivation, the translation of FPN is repressed by iron regulatory proteins (IRPs), which bind to the 5' untranslated region (UTR), to reduce iron export and preserve cellular iron. Here, we report a novel iron-responsive mechanism for the post-transcriptional regulation of FPN, mediated by miR-485-3p, which is induced during iron deficiency and represses FPN expression by directly targeting the FPN 3'UTR. The overexpression of miR-485-3p represses FPN expression and leads to increased cellular ferritin levels, consistent with increased cellular iron. Conversely, both inhibition of miR-485-3p activity and mutation of the miR-485-3p target sites on the FPN 3'UTR are able to relieve FPN repression and lead to decreased cellular iron levels. Together, these findings support a model that includes both IRPs and microRNAs as iron-responsive post-transcriptional regulators of FPN. The involvement of microRNA in the iron-responsive regulation of FPN offers additional stability and fine-tuning of iron homeostasis within different cellular contexts. MiR-485-3p-mediated repression of FPN may also offer a novel potential therapeutic mechanism for circumventing hepcidin-resistant mechanisms responsible for some iron overload diseases.

23593282	Title	miRNA-27b targets vascular endothelial growth factor C to inhibit tumor progression and angiogenesis in colorectal cancer.
23593282	Abstract	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most prevalent cancers globally and is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths due to therapy resistance and metastasis. Understanding the mechanism underlying colorectal carcinogenesis is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of CRC. microRNAs (miRNAs) can act as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors in many cancers. A tumor suppressor role for miR-27b has recently been reported in neuroblastoma, while no information about miR-27b in CRC is available. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-27b expression is decreased in most CRC tissues and determined that overexpression of miR-27b represses CRC cell proliferation, colony formation and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. We identified vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGFC) as a novel target gene of miR-27b and determined that miR-27b functioned as an inhibitor of tumor progression and angiogenesis through targeting VEGFC in CRC. We further determined that DNA hypermethylation of miR-27b CpG islands decreases miR-27b expression. In summary, an anti-tumor role for miR-27b and its novel target VEGFC in vivo could lead to tumor necrosis and provide a rationale for developing miR-27b as a therapeutic agent.

23593351	Title	Expression of regulatory platelet microRNAs in patients with sickle cell disease.
23593351	Abstract	Increased platelet activation in sickle cell disease (SCD) contributes to a state of hypercoagulability and confers a risk of thromboembolic complications. The role for post-transcriptional regulation of the platelet transcriptome by microRNAs (miRNAs) in SCD has not been previously explored. This is the first study to determine whether platelets from SCD exhibit an altered miRNA expression profile. We analyzed the expression of miRNAs isolated from platelets from a primary cohort (SCD = 19, controls = 10) and a validation cohort (SCD = 7, controls = 7) by hybridizing to the Agilent miRNA microarrays. A dramatic difference in miRNA expression profiles between patients and controls was noted in both cohorts separately. A total of 40 differentially expressed platelet miRNAs were identified as common in both cohorts (p-value 0.05, fold change>2) with 24 miRNAs downregulated. Interestingly, 14 of the 24 downregulated miRNAs were members of three families - miR-329, miR-376 and miR-154 - which localized to the epigenetically regulated, maternally imprinted chromosome 14q32 region. We validated the downregulated miRNAs, miR-376a and miR-409-3p, and an upregulated miR-1225-3p using qRT-PCR. Over-expression of the miR-1225-3p in the Meg01 cells was followed by mRNA expression profiling to identify mRNA targets. This resulted in significant transcriptional repression of 1605 transcripts. A combinatorial approach using Meg01 mRNA expression profiles following miR-1225-3p overexpression, a computational prediction analysis of miRNA target sequences and a previously published set of differentially expressed platelet transcripts from SCD patients, identified three novel platelet mRNA targets: PBXIP1, PLAGL2 and PHF20L1. We have identified significant differences in functionally active platelet miRNAs in patients with SCD as compared to controls. These data provide an important inventory of differentially expressed miRNAs in SCD patients and an experimental framework for future studies of miRNAs as regulators of biological pathways in platelets.

23595248	Title	Co-regulation of intragenic microRNA miR-153 and its host gene Ia-2 Beta: identification of miR-153 target genes with functions related to IA-2Beta in pancreas and brain.
23595248	Abstract	We analysed the genomic organisation of miR-153, a microRNA embedded in genes that encode two of the major type 1 diabetes autoantigens, islet-associated protein (IA)-2 and IA-2Beta. We also identified miR-153 target genes that correlated with IA-2Beta localisation and function. A bioinformatics approach was used to identify miR-153's genomic organisation. To analyse the co-regulation of miR-153 and IA-2Beta, quantitative PCR analysis of miR-153 and Ia-2Beta (also known as Ptprn2) was performed after a glucose stimulation assay in MIN6B cells and isolated murine pancreatic islets, and also in wild-type Ia-2 (also known as Ptprn), Ia-2Beta single knockout and Ia-2/Ia-2Beta double knockout mouse brain and pancreatic islets. Bioinformatics identification of miR-153 target genes and validation via luciferase reporter assays, western blotting and quantitative PCR were also carried out. Two copies of miR-153, miR-153-1 and miR-153-2, are localised in intron 19 of Ia-2 and Ia-2Beta, respectively. In rodents, only miR-153-2 is conserved. We demonstrated that expression of miR-153-2 and Ia-2Beta in rodents is partially co-regulated as demonstrated by a strong reduction of miR-153 expression levels in Ia-2Beta knockout and Ia-2/Ia-2Beta double knockout mice. miR-153 levels were unaffected in Ia-2 knockout mice. In addition, glucose stimulation, which increases Ia-2 and Ia-2Beta expression, also significantly increased expression of miR-153. Several predicted targets of miR-153 were reduced after glucose stimulation in vitro, correlating with the increase in miR-153 levels. This study suggests the involvement of miR-153, IA-2Beta and miR-153 target genes in a regulatory network, which is potentially relevant to insulin and neurotransmitter release.

23598412	Title	Redundant miR-3077-5p and miR-705 mediate the shift of mesenchymal stem cell lineage commitment to adipocyte in osteoporosis bone marrow.
23598412	Abstract	During the process of aging, especially for postmenopausal females, the cell lineage commitment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) shift to adipocyte in bone marrow, resulting in osteoporosis. However, the cell-intrinsic mechanism of this cell lineage commitment switch is poorly understood. As the post-transcription regulation by microRNAs (miRNAs) has a critical role in MSCs differentiation and bone homeostasis, we performed comprehensive miRNAs profiling and found miR-705 and miR-3077-5p were significantly enhanced in MSCs from osteoporosis bone marrow. Both miR-705 and miR-3077-5p acted as inhibitors of MSCs osteoblast differentiation and promoters of adipocyte differentiation, by targeting on the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of HOXA10 and RUNX2 mRNA separately. Combined inhibition of miR-705 and miR-3077-5p rescued the cell lineage commitment disorder of MSCs through restoring HOXA10 and RUNX2 protein level. Furthermore, we found excessive TNFAlpha and reactive oxygen species caused by estrogen deficiency led to the upregulation of both miRNAs through NF-KappaB pathway. In conclusion, our findings showed that redundant miR-705 and miR-3077-5p synergistically mediated the shift of MSCs cell lineage commitment to adipocyte in osteoporosis bone marrow, providing new insight into the etiology of osteoporosis at the post-transcriptional level. Moreover, the rescue of MSCs lineage commitment disorder by regulating miRNAs expression suggested a novel potential therapeutic target for osteoporosis as well as stem cell-mediated regenerative medicine.

23603256	Title	MicroRNA-19a/b regulates multidrug resistance in human gastric cancer cells by targeting PTEN.
23603256	Abstract	Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the major cause of failure of gastric cancer chemotherapy. Members of the miR-17-92 cluster, including miR-19a/b, are considered oncomiRs and influence multiple aspects of the malignant phenotype of gastric cancer. However, the role of miR-19a/b in MDR in gastric cancer and its underlying mechanism remain unclear. In this study, we found that miR-19a/b were upregulated in MDR cell lines. Our results also showed that miR-19a/b upregulation decreased the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to anticancer drugs. We further confirmed that miR-19a/b accelerated the ADR efflux of gastric cancer cells by increasing the levels of mdr1 and P-gp and that miR-19a/b suppressed drug-induced apoptosis by regulating Bcl-2 and Bax. Finally, we verified that PTEN, an inhibitor of AKT phosphorylation, is the functional target of miR-19a/b. Overall, these findings demonstrated that miR-19a/b promote MDR in gastric cancer cells by targeting PTEN.

23607462	Title	MicroRNA-520c-3p inhibits hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation and invasion through induction of cell apoptosis by targeting glypican-3.
23607462	Abstract	Glypican-3 (GPC3) is a membrane-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycan involved in regulation of cell proliferation, cell survival, cell migration and differentiation process. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded, non-coding functional RNAs that are important in many biological processes. GPC3 and miRNAs have been found to play essential roles in the development and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, little information about the relationship between GPC3 and miRNAs is available nowadays. Therefore, this study aims to examine the relationship between GPC3 and miRNAs. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to validate the direct target of GPC3. Fluorescence quantitative PCR and Western blotting were used to examined the gene expression at mRNA and protein levels. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis and Annexin V-FITC staining. Invasion of cells was evaluated by Transwell matrigel assay. The results showed that miR-520c-3p could specifically target GPC3 in HCC cells. GPC3 protein levels decreased with unchanged transcription efficiency after miRNA transfection, and there was negative correlation of miR-520c-3p expression in HCC in relate to GPC3 protein levels. Moreover, miR-520c-3p not only induced HCC cell apoptosis, but also inhibited the growth and invasion of the cells. Interestingly, overexpression of GPC3 could effectively reverse apoptosis induced by miR-520c-3p transfection in HCC. Taken together, these results supported that miR-520c-3p may decrease GPC3 protein levels to inhibit proliferation of HCC cells. Therefore, GPC3 could be a new target for genetic diagnosis and treatment of HCC.

23612310	Abstract	Brown adipocytes are a primary site of energy expenditure and reside not only in classical brown adipose tissue but can also be found in white adipose tissue. Here we show that microRNA 155 is enriched in brown adipose tissue and is highly expressed in proliferating brown preadipocytes but declines after induction of differentiation. Interestingly, microRNA 155 and its target, the adipogenic transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein Beta, form a bistable feedback loop integrating hormonal signals that regulate proliferation or differentiation. Inhibition of microRNA 155 enhances brown adipocyte differentiation and induces a brown adipocyte-like phenotype ('browning') in white adipocytes. Consequently, microRNA 155-deficient mice exhibit increased brown adipose tissue function and 'browning' of white fat tissue. In contrast, transgenic overexpression of microRNA 155 in mice causes a reduction of brown adipose tissue mass and impairment of brown adipose tissue function. These data demonstrate that the bistable loop involving microRNA 155 and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein Beta regulates brown lineage commitment, thereby, controlling the development of brown and beige fat cells.

23617834	Title	MicroRNA-32 (miR-32) regulates phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) expression and promotes growth, migration, and invasion in colorectal carcinoma cells.
23617834	Abstract	Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) play important roles in carcinogenesis. MiR-32 has been shown to be upregulated in CRC. In this study, we identified the potential effects of miR-32 on some important biological properties of CRC cells, and clarified the regulation of PTEN by miR-32. The effect of miR-32 on PTEN expression was assessed in CRC cell lines with miR-32 mimics/inhibitor to increase/decrease miR-32 expression. Furthermore, the roles of miR-32 in regulating CRC cells biological properties were analyzed with miR-32 mimics/inhibitor-transfected cells. The 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of PTEN combined with miR-32 was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies showed that overexpression of miR-32 promoted SW480 cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, reduced apoptosis, and resulted in downregulation of PTEN at a posttranscriptional level. However, miR-32 knock-down inhibited these processes in HCT-116 cells and enhanced the expression of PTEN protein. In addition, we further identified PTEN as the functional downstream target of miR-32 by directly targeting the 3'-UTR of PTEN. Our results demonstrated that miR-32 was involved in tumorigenesis of CRC at least in part by suppression of PTEN.

23618526	Title	Effects of knockdown of miR-210 in combination with ionizing radiation on human hepatoma xenograft in nude mice.
23618526	Abstract	Solid tumors usually develop local hypoxia, which renders them resilient to radiotherapy. MiR-210 is the most consistently and robustly induced miRNA under hypoxia and functions as a micro-controller of a wide range of cellular responses to hypoxia. Hence, it is important to investigate the effect of knockdown of miR-210 in tumorigenesis and evaluate the efficacy of knockdown of miR-210 in combination with radiotherapy on human tumor xenograft in nude mice. SMMC-7721 Cells with stable integration of the anti-sense miR-210 were generated through lentiviral-mediated gene transfer and were subcutaneously implanted into nude mice. Mice were monitored for tumor growth and survival after radiotherapy. MiR-210 expression in tumor tissues was assessed by real-time Reverse transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Protein expression of HIF-1Alpha and miR-210 targeted genes in human hepatoma xenograft was assessed by Western blot. Tumors were analyzed for proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis biomarkers by immunohistochemistry staining. Tumor growth was delayed in miR-210 downregulated xenograft. Knockdown of miR-210 increased protein expression of miR-210 targeted genes, but decreased HIF-1Alpha protein in hepatoma xenograft. Knockdown of miR-210 in combination with radiotherapy is more effective than radiotherapy alone or miR-210 knockdown therapy alone in suppressing tumor growth and extending survival duration. Combined therapy decreased Ki-67-positive cells and CD31-positive cells and increased TUNEL-positive cells in tumor xenograft. Knockdown of miR-210 in combination with radiotherapy showed an enhanced anti-tumor effect on human hepatoma xenograft. Our experiments demonstrated specific inhibition of miR-210 expression might be a means to enhance the effectiveness of radiotherapy to human hepatoma. 

23620728	Title	miR-204 targeting of Ankrd13A controls both mesenchymal neural crest and lens cell migration.
23620728	Abstract	Loss of cell adhesion and enhancement of cell motility contribute to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition during development. These processes are related to a) rearrangement of cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesion molecules; b) cross talk between extra-cellular matrix and internal cytoskeleton through focal adhesion molecules. Focal adhesions are stringently regulated transient structures implicated in cell adhesion, spreading and motility during tissue development. Importantly, despite the extensive elucidation of the molecular composition of focal adhesions, the complex regulation of their dynamics is largely unclear. Here, we demonstrate, using live-imaging in medaka, that the microRNA miR-204 promotes both mesenchymal neural crest and lens cell migration and elongation. Overexpression of miR-204 results in upregulated cell motility, while morpholino-mediated ablation of miR-204 activity causes abnormal lens morphogenesis and neural crest cell mislocalization. Using a variety of in vivo and in vitro approaches, we demonstrate that these actions are mediated by the direct targeting of the Ankrd13A gene, which in turn controls focal cell adhesion formation and distribution. Significantly, in vivo restoration of abnormally elevated levels of Ankrd13A resulting from miR-204 inactivation rescued the aberrant lens phenotype in medaka fish. These data uncover, for the first time in vivo, the role of a microRNA in developmental control of mesenchymal cell migration and highlight miR-204 as a "master regulator" of the molecular networks that regulate lens morphogenesis in vertebrates.

23621248	Title	miR-19a promotes cell growth and tumorigenesis through targeting SOCS1 in gastric cancer.
23621248	Abstract	Accumulating evidence has shown that microRNAs are involved in cancer development and progression. However, it remains unknown about the potential role of miR-19a in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. Here, we report that suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) is a novel target of miR-19a in gastric cancer cells and that miR-19a expression is inversely correlated with SOCS1 expression in gastric cancer cells and a subset of gastric cancer tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-19a dramatically promoted proliferation and tumorigenicity of gastric cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we showed that silencing of SOCS1 promoted cell growth and colony formation resembling that of miR-19a overexpression, whereas re-introduction of SOCS1 (without the 3'-UTR) attenuated the pro-tumorigenic functions. Taken together, our findings suggest that the SOCS1 gene is a direct target of miR-19a, which functions as an oncogenic miRNA in gastric cancer by repressing the expression of tumor suppressor SOCS1.

23626677	Title	Characterization of novel precursor miRNAs using next generation sequencing and prediction of miRNA targets in Atlantic halibut.
23626677	Abstract	microRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in regulation of many cellular processes. miRNAs are processed to their mature functional form in a step-wise manner by multiple proteins and cofactors in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Many miRNAs are conserved across vertebrates. Mature miRNAs have recently been characterized in Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.). The aim of this study was to identify and characterize precursor miRNA (pre-miRNAs) and miRNA targets in this non-model flatfish. Discovery of miRNA precursor forms and targets in non-model organisms is difficult because of limited source information available. Therefore, we have developed a methodology to overcome this limitation. Genomic DNA and small transcriptome of Atlantic halibut were sequenced using Roche 454 pyrosequencing and SOLiD next generation sequencing (NGS), respectively. Identified pre- miRNAs were further validated with reverse-transcription PCR. miRNA targets were identified using miRanda and RNAhybrid target prediction tools using sequences from public databases. Some of miRNA targets were also identified using RACE-PCR. miRNA binding sites were validated with luciferase assay using the RTS34st cell line. We obtained more than 1.3 M and 92 M sequence reads from 454 genomic DNA sequencing and SOLiD small RNA sequencing, respectively. We identified 34 known and 9 novel pre-miRNAs. We predicted a number of miRNA target genes involved in various biological pathways. miR-24 binding to kisspeptin 1 receptor-2 (kiss1-r2) was confirmed using luciferase assay. This study demonstrates that identification of conserved and novel pre-miRNAs in a non-model vertebrate lacking substantial genomic resources can be performed by combining different next generation sequencing technologies. Our results indicate a wide conservation of miRNA precursors and involvement of miRNA in multiple regulatory pathways, and provide resources for further research on miRNA in non-model animals.

23626837	Title	Sox9-regulated miRNA-574-3p inhibits chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.
23626837	Abstract	The aim of this study was to identify new microRNAs (miRNAs) that are modulated during the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) toward chondrocytes. Using large scale miRNA arrays, we compared the expression of miRNAs in MSCs (day 0) and at early time points (day 0.5 and 3) after chondrogenesis induction. Transfection of premiRNA or antagomiRNA was performed on MSCs before chondrogenesis induction and expression of miRNAs and chondrocyte markers was evaluated at different time points during differentiation by RT-qPCR. Among miRNAs that were modulated during chondrogenesis, we identified miR-574-3p as an early up-regulated miRNA. We found that miR-574-3p up-regulation is mediated via direct binding of Sox9 to its promoter region and demonstrated by reporter assay that retinoid X receptor (RXR)Alpha is one gene specifically targeted by the miRNA. In vitro transfection of MSCs with premiR-574-3p resulted in the inhibition of chondrogenesis demonstrating its role during the commitment of MSCs towards chondrocytes. In vivo, however, both up- and down-regulation of miR-574-3p expression inhibited differentiation toward cartilage and bone in a model of heterotopic ossification. In conclusion, we demonstrated that Sox9-dependent up-regulation of miR-574-3p results in RXRAlpha down-regulation. Manipulating miR-574-3p levels both in vitro and in vivo inhibited chondrogenesis suggesting that miR-574-3p might be required for chondrocyte lineage maintenance but also that of MSC multipotency.

23627607	Title	MicroRNA profile of paclitaxel-resistant serous ovarian carcinoma based on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples.
23627607	Abstract	To assess the feasibility of validating microRNA (miRNA) profile related to paclitaxel-sensitivity in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples of serous ovarian carcinoma (OC) patients. Deregulated miRNAs identified by miRNA microarray were further detected in 45 FFPE OC samples using Realtime PCR. Correlations between paired FFPE and frozen tumor samples were analyzed. Survival times were compared between 6 high and low miRNAs groups. Western blot and luciferase reporter assay were used for validating the target of miRNA. Sixteen up-regulated miRNAs and twenty-three down-regulated miRNAs were revealed in pacilitaxel-resistant ST30 cells. The up-regulated miRNAs (miR-320a, 22 and 129-5p) and down-regulated miRNAs (miR-9, 155 and 640) were confirmed in paclitaxel-resistant FFPE tumor samples, compared with paclitaxel-sensitive samples. Higher miR-9 and miR-640 showed better survival time in OC patients. Expressions of miR-9, 155 and 22 in FFPE samples were closely mimicked by those in frozen tissues. RAB34 was validated as a direct target of miR-9. We validated miRNA profile in pacilitaxel-resistant OC using FFPE samples, which might enable treatment stratification and help us to predict outcomes in OC patients. FFPE samples are feasible materials for miRNA research.

23630541	Title	miR-221 affects multiple cancer pathways by modulating the level of hundreds messenger RNAs.
23630541	Abstract	microRNA miR-221 is frequently over-expressed in a variety of human neoplasms. Aim of this study was to identify new miR-221 gene targets to improve our understanding on the molecular tumor-promoting mechanisms affected by miR-221. Gene expression profiling of miR-221-transfected-SNU-398 cells was analyzed by the Sylamer algorithm to verify the enrichment of miR-221 targets among down-modulated genes. This analysis revealed that enforced expression of miR-221 in SNU-398 cells caused the down-regulation of 602 mRNAs carrying sequences homologous to miR-221 seed sequence within their 3'UTRs. Pathways analysis performed on these genes revealed their prominent involvement in cell proliferation and apoptosis. Activation of E2F, MYC, NFkB, and Beta-catenin pathways was experimentally proven. Some of the new miR-221 target genes, including RB1, WEE1 (cell cycle inhibitors), APAF1 (pro-apoptotic), ANXA1, CTCF (transcriptional repressor), were individually validated as miR-221 targets in SNU-398, HepG2, and HEK293 cell lines. By identifying a large set of miR-221 gene targets, this study improves our knowledge about miR-221 molecular mechanisms involved in tumorigenesis. The modulation of mRNA level of 602 genes confirms the ability of miR-221 to promote cancer by affecting multiple oncogenic pathways.

23633945	Title	HCV-induced miR-21 contributes to evasion of host immune system by targeting MyD88 and IRAK1.
23633945	Abstract	Upon recognition of viral components by pattern recognition receptors, such as the toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like helicases, cells are activated to produce type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines. These pathways are tightly regulated by the host to prevent an inappropriate cellular response, but viruses can modulate these pathways to proliferate and spread. In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism in which hepatitis C virus (HCV) evades the immune surveillance system to proliferate by activating microRNA-21 (miR-21). We demonstrated that HCV infection upregulates miR-21, which in turn suppresses HCV-triggered type I IFN production, thus promoting HCV replication. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-21 targets two important factors in the TLR signaling pathway, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), which are involved in HCV-induced type I IFN production. HCV-mediated activation of miR-21 expression requires viral proteins and several signaling components. Moreover, we identified a transcription factor, activating protein-1 (AP-1), which is partly responsible for miR-21 induction in response to HCV infection through PKCEpsilon/JNK/c-Jun and PKCAlpha/ERK/c-Fos cascades. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-21 is upregulated during HCV infection and negatively regulates IFN-Alpha signaling through MyD88 and IRAK1 and may be a potential therapeutic target for antiviral intervention.

23637592	Title	OncomiR addiction is generated by a miR-155 feedback loop in Theileria-transformed leukocytes.
23637592	Abstract	The intracellular parasite Theileria is the only eukaryote known to transform its mammalian host cells. We investigated the host mechanisms involved in parasite-induced transformation phenotypes. Tumour progression is a multistep process, yet 'oncogene addiction' implies that cancer cell growth and survival can be impaired by inactivating a single gene, offering a rationale for targeted molecular therapies. Furthermore, feedback loops often act as key regulatory hubs in tumorigenesis. We searched for microRNAs involved in addiction to regulatory loops in leukocytes infected with Theileria parasites. We show that Theileria transformation involves induction of the host bovine oncomiR miR-155, via the c-Jun transcription factor and AP-1 activity. We identified a novel miR-155 target, DET1, an evolutionarily-conserved factor involved in c-Jun ubiquitination. We show that miR-155 expression led to repression of DET1 protein, causing stabilization of c-Jun and driving the promoter activity of the BIC transcript containing miR-155. This positive feedback loop is critical to maintain the growth and survival of Theileria-infected leukocytes; transformation is reversed by inhibiting AP-1 activity or miR-155 expression. This is the first demonstration that Theileria parasites induce the expression of host non-coding RNAs and highlights the importance of a novel feedback loop in maintaining the proliferative phenotypes induced upon parasite infection. Hence, parasite infection drives epigenetic rewiring of the regulatory circuitry of host leukocytes, placing miR-155 at the crossroads between infection, regulatory circuits and transformation.

23640459	Title	The targeting and functions of miRNA-383 are mediated by FMRP during spermatogenesis.
23640459	Abstract	Our previous studies have shown that microRNA-383 (miR-383) expression is downregulated in the testes of infertile men with maturation arrest (MA). Abnormal testicular miR-383 expression may potentiate the connections between male infertility and testicular germ cell tumors. However, the mechanisms underlying the targeting and functions of miR-383 during spermatogenesis remain unknown. In this study, we found that fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) was associated with 88 miRNAs in mouse testis including miR-383. Knockdown of FMRP in NTERA-2 (NT2) (testicular embryonal carcinoma) cells enhanced miR-383-induced suppression of cell proliferation by decreasing the interaction between FMRP and miR-383, and then affecting miR-383 binding to the 3'-untranslated region of its target genes, including interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF1) and Cyclin D1 both in vivo and in vitro. On the other hand, FMRP levels were also downregulated by overexpression of miR-383 in NT2 cells and GC1 (spermatogonia germ cell line). miR-383 targeted to Cyclin D1 directly, and then inhibited its downstream effectors, including phosphorylated pRb and E2F1, which ultimately resulted in decreased FMRP expression. Reduced miR-383 expression, dysregulated cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expression (one of the downstream genes of miR-383) and increased DNA damage were also observed in the testes of Fmr1 knockout mice and of MA patients with a downregulation of FMRP. A potential feedback loop between FMRP and miR-383 during spermatogenesis is proposed, and FMRP acts as a negative regulator of miR-383 functions. Our data also indicate that dysregulation of the FMRP-miR-383 pathway may partially contribute to human spermatogenic failure with MA.

23646287	Title	Differential expression of miR-1, a putative tumor suppressing microRNA, in cancer resistant and cancer susceptible mice.
23646287	Abstract	Mus spretus mice are highly resistant to several types of cancer compared to Mus musculus mice. To determine whether differences in microRNA (miRNA) expression account for some of the differences in observed skin cancer susceptibility between the strains, we performed miRNA expression profiling of skin RNA for over 300 miRNAs. Five miRNAs, miR-1, miR-124a-3, miR-133a, miR-134, miR-206, were differentially expressed by array and/or qPCR. miR-1 was previously shown to have tumor suppressing abilities in multiple tumor types. We found miR-1 expression to be lower in mouse cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCCs) compared to normal skin. Based on the literature and our expression data, we performed detailed studies on predicted miR-1 targets and evaluated the effect of miR-1 expression on two murine cSCC cell lines, A5 and B9. Following transfection of miR-1, we found decreased mRNA expression of three validated miR-1 targets, Met, Twf1 and Ets1 and one novel target Bag4. Decreased expression of Ets1 was confirmed by Western analysis and by 3' reporter luciferase assays containing wildtype and mutated Ets1 3'UTR. We evaluated the effect of miR-1 on multiple tumor phenotypes including apoptosis, proliferation, cell cycle and migration. In A5 cells, expression of miR-1 led to decreased proliferation compared to a control miR. miR-1 expression also led to increased apoptosis at later time points (72 and 96 h) and to a decrease in cells in S-phase. In summary, we identified five miRNAs with differential expression between cancer resistant and cancer susceptible mice and found that miR-1, a candidate tumor suppressor, has targets with defined roles in tumorigenesis.

23657814	Title	Transforming growth factor-Beta1 selectively inhibits hepatocyte growth factor expression via a micro-RNA-199-dependent posttranscriptional mechanism.
23657814	Abstract	Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a multipotent endogenous repair factor secreted primarily by mesenchymal cells with effects on cells expressing its receptor, Met. HGF promotes normal tissue regeneration and inhibits fibrotic remodeling in part by promoting proliferation and migration of endothelial and epithelial cells and protecting these cells from apoptosis. HGF also inhibits myofibroblast proliferation. The profibrotic cytokine transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-Beta1) suppresses HGF expression but not the expression of NK2, an HGF splice variant that antagonizes HGF-induced proliferation. We investigated the mechanism for differential regulation of HGF and NK2 by TGF-Beta1. TGF-Beta1 down-regulated HGF in primary human adult pulmonary fibroblasts (HLFb) and increased the expression of miR-199a-3p, a microRNA (miRNA) associated with fibrotic remodeling. HGF and NK2 contain completely different 3' untranslated regions (UTRs), and we determined that miR-199a-3p targeted HGF mRNA for suppression but not NK2. A pre-miR-199 mimic inhibited the expression of a luciferase reporter harboring the HGF 3' UTR but not a pmirGLO reporter containing the NK2 3' UTR. In contrast, an anti-miRNA inhibitor specific for miR-199a-3p prevented TGF-Beta1-induced reduction of both HGF mRNA and HGF protein secretion. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that HGF is distinctly regulated at the posttranscriptional level from its antagonist NK2.

23661430	Title	Putative tumor suppressor gene SEL1L was downregulated by aberrantly upregulated hsa-mir-155 in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.
23661430	Abstract	Sel-1-like (SEL1L) is a putative tumor suppressor gene that is significantly downregulated in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). The mechanism of the downregulation is unclear. Here, we investigated whether aberrantly upregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) repressed the expression of SEL1L. From reported miRNA microarray studies on PDA and predicted miRNA targets, we identified seven aberrantly upregulated miRNAs that potentially target SEL1L. We assessed the expression levels of SEL1L mRNA and the seven miRNAs in human PDA tumors and normal adjacent tissues using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Then statistical methods were applied to evaluate the association between SEL1L mRNA and the miRNAs. Furthermore, the interaction was explored by functional analysis, including luciferase assay and transient miRNA overexpression. SEL1L mRNA expression levels were found to correlate inversely with the expression of hsa-mir-143, hsa-mir-155, and hsa-mir-223 (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, and P = 0.002, respectively). As the number of these overexpressed miRNAs increased, SEL1L mRNA expression progressively decreased (Ptrend  = 0.001). Functional analysis revealed that hsa-mir-155 acted as a suppressor of SEL1L in PDA cell lines. Our study combined statistical analysis with biological approaches to determine the relationships between several miRNAs and the SEL1L gene. The finding that the expression of the putative tumor suppressor SEL1L is repressed by upregulation of hsa-mir-155 helps to elucidate the mechanism for SEL1L downregulation in some human PDA cases. Our results suggest a role for specific miRNAs in the pathogenesis of PDA and indicate that miRNAs have potential as therapeutic targets for PDA.

23662917	Title	Differentiation of human dental stem cells reveals a role for microRNA-218.
23662917	Abstract	Regeneration of lost periodontium is the ultimate goal of periodontal therapy. Advances in tissue engineering have demonstrated the multilineage potential and plasticity of adult stem cells located in periodontal apparatus. However, it remains unclear how epigenetic mechanisms controlling signals determine tissue specification and cell lineage decisions. To date, no data are available on micro-RNA (miRNA) activity behind human-derived dental stem cells (DSCs). In this study, we isolated periodontal ligament stem cells, dental pulp stem cells and gingival stem cells from extracted third molars; human bone marrow stem cells were used as a positive control. The expression of OCT4A and NANOG was confirmed in these undifferentiated cells. All cells were cultured under osteogenic inductive conditions and RUNX2 expression was analyzed as a marker of mineralized tissue differentiation. The miRNA expression profile was obtained at baseline and after osteogenic induction in all cell types. The expression of RUNX2 demonstrated successful osteogenic induction of all cell types, which was confirmed by alizarin red stain. The analysis of 765 miRNAs demonstrated a shift in miRNA expression that occurred in all four stem cell types, including a decrease in hsa-mir-218 across all differentiated cell populations. Hsa-mir-218 targets RUNX2 and decreases RUNX2 expression in undifferentiated human DSCs. DSC mineralized tissue type differentiation is associated with a decrease in hsa-mir-218 expression. These data reveal a miRNA-regulated pathway for the differentiation of human DSCs and a select network of human miRNAs that control DSC osteogenic differentiation.

23667495	Title	Multiple-to-multiple relationships between microRNAs and target genes in gastric cancer.
23667495	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as transcriptional regulators and play pivotal roles in carcinogenesis. According to miRNA target databases, one miRNA may regulate many genes as its targets, while one gene may be targeted by many miRNAs. These findings indicate that relationships between miRNAs and their targets may not be one-to-one. However, many reports have described only a one-to-one, one-to-multiple or multiple-to-one relationship between miRNA and its target gene in human cancers. Thus, it is necessary to determine whether or not a combination of some miRNAs would regulate multiple targets and be involved in carcinogenesis. To find some groups of miRNAs that may synergistically regulate their targets in human gastric cancer (GC), we re-analyzed our previous miRNA expression array data and found that 50 miRNAs were up-regulated on treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine in a GC cell line. The "TargetScan" miRNA target database predicted that some of these miRNAs have common target genes. We also referred to the GEO database for expression of these common target genes in human GCs, which might be related to gastric carcinogenesis. In this study, we analyzed two miRNA combinations, miR-224 and -452, and miR-181c and -340. Over-expression of both miRNA combinations dramatically down-regulated their target genes, DPYSL2 and KRAS, and KRAS and MECP2, respectively. These miRNA combinations synergistically decreased cell proliferation upon transfection. Furthermore, we revealed that these miRNAs were down-regulated through promoter hypermethylation in GC cells. Thus, it is likely that the relationships between miRNAs and their targets are not one-to-one but multiple-to-multiple in GCs, and that these complex relationships may be related to gastric carcinogenesis.

23675407	Title	Upregulation of miR-150* and miR-630 induces apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells by targeting IGF-1R.
23675407	Abstract	MicroRNAs have been implicated in many critical cellular processes including apoptosis. We have previously found that apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells was induced by adamantyl retinoid-related (ARR) molecule 3-Cl-AHPC. Here we report that 3-Cl-AHPC-dependent apoptosis involves regulating a number of microRNAs including miR-150* and miR-630. 3-Cl-AHPC stimulated miR-150* expression and caused decreased expression of c-Myb and IGF-1R in the pancreatic cancer cells. 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated reduction of c-Myb resulted in diminished binding of c-Myb with IGF-1R and Bcl-2 promoters, thereby causing repression of their transcription and protein expression. Over-expression of miR-150* also resulted in diminished levels of c-Myb and Bcl-2 proteins. Furthermore, the addition of the miRNA inhibitor 2'-O-methylated miR-150 blocked 3-Cl-AHPC-mediated increase in miR-150* levels and abrogated loss of c-Myb protein. Knockdown of c-Myb in PANC-1 cells resulted in enhanced apoptosis both in the presence or absence of 3-Cl-AHPC confirming the anti-apoptotic property of c-Myb. Overexpression of miR-630 also induced apoptosis in the pancreatic cancer cells and inhibited target protein IGF-1R mRNA and protein expression. Together these results implicate key roles for miR-150* and miR-630 and their targeting of IGF-1R to promote apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells.

23678987	Title	Control of post-translational modifications in antithrombin during murine post-natal development by miR-200a.
23678987	Abstract	Developmental haemostatic studies may help identifying new elements involved in the control of key haemostatic proteins like antithrombin, the most relevant endogenous anticoagulant. In this study, we showed a significant reduction of sialic acid content in neonatal antithrombin compared with adult antithrombin in mice. mRNA levels of St3gal3 and St3gal4, two sialyltransferases potentially involved in antithrombin sialylation, were 85% lower in neonates in comparison with adults. In silico analysis of miRNAs overexpressed in neonates revealed that mir-200a might target these sialyltransferases. Moreover, in vitro studies in murine primary hepatocytes sustain this potential control. These data suggest that in addition to the direct protein regulation, microRNAs may also modulate qualitative traits of selected proteins by an indirect control of post-translational processes.

23688035	Title	MicroRNA-488 regulates zinc transporter SLC39A8/ZIP8 during pathogenesis of osteoarthritis.
23688035	Abstract	Even though osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common musculoskeletal dysfunction, there are no effective pharmacological treatments to treat OA due to lack of understanding in OA pathology. To better understand the mechanism in OA pathogenesis and investigate its effective target, we analyzed miRNA profiles during OA pathogenesis and verify the role and its functional targets of miR-488. Human articular chondrocytes were obtained from cartilage of OA patients undergoing knee replacement surgery and biopsy samples of normal cartilage and the expression profile of miRNA was analyzed. From expression profile, most potent miR was selected and its target and functional role in OA pathogenesis were investigated using target validation system and OA animal model system. Among miRNAs tested, miR-488 was significantly decreased in OA chondrocytes Furthermore, we found that exposure of IL-1Beta was also suppressed whereas exposure of TGF-Beta3 induced the induction of miR-488 in human articular chondrocytes isolated from biopsy samples of normal cartilages. Target validation study showed that miR-488 targets ZIP8 and suppression of ZIP8 in OA animal model showed the reduced cartilage degradation. Target validation study showed that miR-488 targets ZIP8 and suppression of ZIP8 in OA animal model showed the reduced cartilage degradation. miR-488 acts as a positive role for chondrocyte differentiation/cartilage development by inhibiting MMP-13 activity through targeting ZIP-8.

23689287	Title	Overexpression of miR-26a-2 in human liposarcoma is correlated with poor patient survival.
23689287	Abstract	Approximately 90% of well-differentiated/de-differentiated liposarcomas (WDLPS/DDLPS), the most common LPS subtype, have chromosomal amplification at 12q13-q22. Many protein-coding genes in the region, such as MDM2 and , have been studied as potential therapeutic targets for LPS treatment, with minimal success. In the amplified region near the MDM2 gene, our single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis of 75 LPS samples identified frequent amplification of miR-26a-2. Besides being in the amplicon, miR-26a-2 was overexpressed significantly in WDLPS/DDLPS (P<0.001), as well as in myxoid/round cell LPS (MRC) (P<0.05). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that overexpression of miR-26a-2 significantly correlated with poor patient survival in both types of LPS (P<0.05 for WDLPS/DDLPS; P<0.001 for MRC). Based on these findings, we hypothesized that miR-26a-2 has an important role in LPS tumorigenesis, regardless of LPS subtypes. Overexpression of miR-26a-2 in three LPS cell lines (SW872, LPS141 and LP6) enhanced the growth and survival of these cells, including faster cell proliferation and migration, enhanced clonogenicity, suppressed adipocyte differentiation and/or resistance to apoptosis. Inhibition of miR-26a-2 in LPS cells using anti-miR-26a-2 resulted in the opposite responses. To explain further the effect of miR-26a-2 overexpression in LPS cells, we performed in silico analysis and identified 93 candidate targets of miR-26a-2. Among these genes, RCBTB1 (regulator of chromosome condensation and BTB domain-containing protein 1) is located at 13q12.3-q14.3, a region of recurrent loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in LPS. Indeed, either overexpression or inhibition of RCBTB1 made LPS cells more susceptible or resistant to apoptosis, respectively. In conclusion, our study for the first time reveals the contribution of miR-26a-2 to LPS tumorigenesis, partly through inhibiting RCBTB1, suggesting that miR-26a-2 is a novel therapeutic target for human LPS.

23690952	Title	miR-655 Is an EMT-suppressive microRNA targeting ZEB1 and TGFBR2.
23690952	Abstract	Recently, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been demonstrated to contribute to normal and disease processes including cancer progression. To explore EMT-suppressive microRNAs (miRNAs), we established a cell-based reporter system using a stable clone derived from a pancreatic cancer cell line, Panc1, transfected with a reporter construct containing a promoter sequence of CDH1/E-cadherin in the 5' upstream region of the ZsGreen1 reporter gene. Then, we performed function-based screening with 470 synthetic double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) mimicking human mature miRNAs using the system and identified miR-655 as a novel EMT-suppressive miRNA. Overexpression of miR-655 not only induced the upregulation of E-cadherin and downregulation of typical EMT-inducers but also suppressed migration and invasion of mesenchymal-like cancer cells accompanied by a morphological shift toward the epithelial phenotype. In addition, we found a significant correlation between miR-655 expression and a better prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Moreover, ZEB1 and TGFBR2, which are essential components of the TGF-b signaling pathway, were identified as direct targets of miR-655, suggesting that the activation of the TGF-b-ZEB1-E-cadherin axis by aberrant downregulation of miR-655 may accelerate cancer progression.

23690991	Title	miR-219-5p inhibits receptor tyrosine kinase pathway by targeting EGFR in glioblastoma.
23690991	Abstract	Glioblastoma is one of the common types of primary brain tumors with a median survival of 12-15 months. The receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathway is known to be deregulated in 88% of the patients with glioblastoma. 45% of GBM patients show amplifications and activating mutations in EGFR gene leading to the upregulation of the pathway. In the present study, we demonstrate that a brain specific miRNA, miR-219-5p, repressed EGFR by directly binding to its 3'-UTR. The expression of miR-219-5p was downregulated in glioblastoma and the overexpression of miR-219-5p in glioma cell lines inhibited the proliferation, anchorage independent growth and migration. In addition, miR-219-5p inhibited MAPK and PI3K pathways in glioma cell lines in concordance with its ability to target EGFR. The inhibitory effect of miR-219-5p on MAPK and PI3K pathways and glioma cell migration could be rescued by the overexpression of wild type EGFR and vIII mutant of EGFR (both lacking 3'-UTR and thus being insensitive to miR-219-5p) suggesting that the inhibitory effects of miR-219-5p were indeed because of its ability to target EGFR. We also found significant negative correlation between miR-219-5p levels and total as well as phosphorylated forms of EGFR in glioblastoma patient samples. This indicated that the downregulation of miR-219-5p in glioblastoma patients contribute to the increased activity of the RTK pathway by the upregulation of EGFR. Thus, we have identified and characterized miR-219-5p as the RTK regulating novel tumor suppressor miRNA in glioblastoma.

23691483	Title	GNAI1 Suppresses Tumor Cell Migration and Invasion and is Post-Transcriptionally Regulated by Mir-320a/c/d in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.
23691483	Abstract	To explore the role and regulation of guanine nucleotide-binding protein G(i), Alpha-1 subunit (GNAI1) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Expression of GNAI1 in HCC samples was determined by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. Huh-7 and SNU-387 cells stably expressing GNAI1 were established by the infection of lentivirus transducing unit containing GNAI1. siRNA against GNAI1 was transfected into SMMC-7721 cells to knock down the GNAI1 expression in HCC cells. Mir-320a/c/d mimics were transfected into SMMC-7721 and SK-Hep-1 cells and the expression of GNAI1 was determined by Western blot. The migration and invasion of Huh-7, SNU-387, SK-Hep-1 and SMMC-7721 cells were investigated by Transwell assays. The GNAI1 protein was significantly downregulated in HCC samples without changes in its mRNA levels. GNAI1 could inhibit the migration and invasion of HCC cells in vitro. Further investigations indicated that GNAI1 was a target of miR-320a/c/d in HCC cells. Transwell assays demonstrated that these microRNAs could promote the migratory ability and invasivesess of HCC cells in vitro. GNAI1 is downregulated in HCC and inhibits the migration and invasion of HCC cells. This study is the first to investigate the role of GNAI1 in cancer. Regulation of GNAI1 by miR-320a/c/d indicates new therapeutic avenues for targeting HCC metastasis.

23691514	Title	MicroRNA-124 regulates the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells by targeting iASPP.
23691514	Abstract	MicroRNAs are a class of small, noncoding RNAs that function as critical regulators of gene expression by targeting mRNAs for translational repression or degradation. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of microRNA-124 (miR-124) is significantly downregulated in colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines, compared to the matched adjacent tissues. We identified and confirmed inhibitor of apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 (iASPP) as a novel, direct target of miR-124 using target prediction algorithms and luciferase reporter gene assays. Overexpression of miR-124 suppressed iASPP protein expression, upregulated expression of the downstream signaling molecule nuclear factor-kappa B (NF- Kappa B), and attenuated cell viability, proliferation, and colony formation in SW480 and HT-29 colorectal cancer cells in vitro. Forced overexpression of iASPP partly rescued the inhibitory effect of miR-124 on SW480 and HT29 cell proliferation. Taken together, these findings shed light on the role and mechanism of action of miR-124, indicate that the miR-124/iASPP axis can regulate the proliferation of colorectal cancer cells, and suggest that miR-124 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for colorectal cancer.

23695020	Title	Proto-oncogenic isoform A2 of eukaryotic translation elongation factor eEF1 is a target of miR-663 and miR-744.
23695020	Abstract	Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A2 (eEF1A2) is a known proto-oncogene. We proposed that stimulation of the eEF1A2 expression in cancer tissues is caused by the loss of miRNA-mediated control. Impact of miRNAs on eEF1A2 at the mRNA and protein levels was examined by qPCR and western blot, respectively. Dual-luciferase assay was applied to examine the influence of miRNAs on 3'-UTR of EEF1A2. To detect miRNA-binding sites, mutations into the 3'-UTR of EEF1A2 mRNA were introduced by the overlap extension PCR. miR-663 and miR-744 inhibited the expression of luciferase gene attached to the 3'-UTR of EEF1A2 up to 20% and 50%, respectively. In MCF7 cells, overexpression of miR-663 and miR-744 reduced the EEF1A2 mRNA level by 30% and 50%. Analogous effects were also observed at the eEF1A2 protein level. In resveratrol-treated MCF7 cells the upregulation of mir-663 and mir-744 was accompanied by downregulation of EEF1A2 mRNA. Both miRNAs were able to inhibit the proliferation of MCF7 cells. miR-663 and miR-744 mediate inhibition of the proto-oncogene eEF1A2 expression that results in retardation of the MCF7 cancer cells proliferation. Antitumour effect of resveratrol may include stimulation of the miR-663 and miR-744 expression.

23696749	Title	ATM-dependent MiR-335 targets CtIP and modulates the DNA damage response.
23696749	Abstract	ATM plays a critical role in cellular responses to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). We describe a new ATM-mediated DSB-induced DNA damage response pathway involving microRNA (miRNA): irradiation (IR)-induced DSBs activate ATM, which leads to the downregulation of miR-335, a miRNA that targets CtIP, which is an important trigger of DNA end resection in homologous recombination repair (HRR). We demonstrate that CREB is responsible for a large portion of miR-335 expression by binding to the promoter region of miR-335. CREB binding is greatly reduced after IR, corroborating with previous studies that IR-activated ATM phosphorylates CREB to reduce its transcription activity. Overexpression of miR-335 in HeLa cells resulted in reduced CtIP levels and post-IR colony survival and BRCA1 foci formation. Further, in two patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines with decreased post-IR colony survival, a "radiosensitive" phenotype, we demonstrated elevated miR-335 expression, reduced CtIP levels, and reduced BRCA1 foci formation. Colony survival, BRCA1 foci, and CtIP levels were partially rescued by miRNA antisense AMO-miR-335 treatment. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that an ATM-dependent CREB-miR-335-CtIP axis influences the selection of HRR for repair of certain DSB lesions.

23704927	Title	Alterations of serum levels of BDNF-related miRNAs in patients with depression.
23704927	Abstract	Depression is a serious and potentially life-threatening mental disorder with unknown etiology. Emerging evidence shows that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and microRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in the etiology of depression. Here this study was aimed to identify and characterize the roles of BDNF and its putative regulatory miRNAs in depression. First, we identified that miR-182 may be a putative miRNA that regulates BDNF levels by bioinformatic studies, and characterized the effects of miR-182 on the BDNF levels using cell-based studies, side by side with miR-132 (a known miRNA that regulates BDNF expression). We showed that treatment of miR-132 and miR-182 respectively decreased the BDNF protein levels in a human neuronal cell model, supporting the regulatory roles of miR-132 and miR-182 on the BDNF expression. Furthermore, we explored the roles of miR-132 and miR-182 on the BDNF levels in depression using human subjects by assessing their serum levels. Compared with the healthy controls, patients with depression showed lower serum BDNF levels (via the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) and higher serum miR-132 and miR-182 levels (via the real-time PCR). Finally, the Pearson's (or Spearman's) correlation coefficient was calculated to study whether there was a relationship among the Self-Rating Depression Scale score, the serum BDNF levels, and serum BDNF-related miRNA levels. Our results revealed that there was a significant negative correlation between the SDS scores and the serum BDNF levels, and a positive correlation between the SDS scores and miR-132 levels. In addition, we found a reverse relationship between the serum BDNF levels and the miR-132/miR-182 levels in depression. Collectively, we provided evidence supporting that miR-182 is a putative BDNF-regulatory miRNA, and suggested that the serum BDNF and its related miRNAs may be utilized as important biomarkers in the diagnosis or as therapeutic targets of depression.

23705032	Title	Stretch-sensitive down-regulation of the miR-144/451 cluster in vascular smooth muscle and its role in AMP-activated protein kinase signaling.
23705032	Abstract	Vascular smooth muscle cells are constantly exposed to mechanical force by the blood pressure, which is thought to regulate smooth muscle growth, differentiation and contractile function. We have previously shown that the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs, is essential for regulation of smooth muscle phenotype including stretch-dependent contractile differentiation. In this study, we have investigated the effect of mechanical stretch on miRNA expression and the role of stretch-sensitive miRNAs for intracellular signaling in smooth muscle. MiRNA array analysis, comparing miRNA levels in stretched versus non-stretched portal veins, revealed a dramatic decrease in the miR-144/451 cluster level. Because this miRNA cluster is predicted to target AMPK pathway components, we next examined activation of this pathway. Diminished miR-144/451 expression was inversely correlated with increased phosphorylation of AMPKAlpha at Thr172 in stretched portal vein. Similar to the effect of stretch, contractile differentiation could be induced in non-stretched portal veins by the AMPK activator, AICAR. Transfection with miR-144/451 mimics reduced the protein expression level of mediators in the AMPK pathway including MO25Alpha, AMPK and ACC. This effect also decreased AICAR-induced activation of the AMPK signaling pathway. In conclusion, our results suggest that stretch-induced activation of AMPK in vascular smooth muscle is in part regulated by reduced levels of miR-144/451 and that this effect may play a role in promoting contractile differentiation of smooth muscle cells.

23706078	Title	Celastrol induces apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by miR-146a inhibition of NF-KappaB activity.
23706078	Abstract	Celastrol, a plant triterpene, is known to play important role in inhibiting proliferation and inducing apoptosis of gastric cancer cells. In the present study, the mechanism of celastrol on gastric cancer cells apoptosis was examined. We assessed effect of celastrol on NF-KappaB signaling pathway in gastric cancer cells using western blot and luciferase reporter assay. The real-time PCR was used to evaluate the effect of celastrol on miR-146a expression, and miR-146a mimic to evaluate whether over-expression of miR-146a can affect NF-KappaB activity. Finally, the effect of miR-146a on celastrol-induced anti-tumor activity was assessed using miR-146a inhibitor. Celastrol decreased gastric cancer cells viability in a dose-dependent. Celastrol also reduced IKappaB phosphorylation, nuclear P65 protein levels and NF-KappaB activity. Furthermore, Celastrol could increase miR-146a expression and up-regulation of miR-146a expression could suppress NF-KappaB activity. More important, down-regulation of miR-146a expression can reverse the effect of celastrol on NF-KappaB activity and apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrated that the effect of celastrol on apoptosis is due to miR-146a inhibition of NF-KappaB activity.

23708087	Title	The microRNA-200 family targets multiple non-small cell lung cancer prognostic markers in H1299 cells and BEAS-2B cells.
23708087	Abstract	Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality for both men and women. Tumor recurrence and metastasis is the major cause of lung cancer treatment failure and death. The microRNA‑200 (miR-200) family is a powerful regulator of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process, which is essential in tumor metastasis. Nevertheless, miR-200 family target genes that promote metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain largely unknown. Here, we sought to investigate whether the microRNA-200 family regulates our previously identified NSCLC prognostic marker genes associated with metastasis, as potential molecular targets. Novel miRNA targets were predicted using bioinformatics tools based on correlation analyses of miRNA and mRNA expression in 57 squamous cell lung cancer tumor samples. The predicted target genes were validated with quantitative RT-PCR assays and western blot analysis following re-expression of miR-200a, -200b and -200c in the metastatic NSCLC H1299 cell line. The results show that restoring miR-200a or miR-200c in H1299 cells induces downregulation of DLC1, ATRX and HFE. Reinforced miR-200b expression results in downregulation of DLC1, HNRNPA3 and HFE. Additionally, miR-200 family downregulates HNRNPR3, HFE and ATRX in BEAS-2B immortalized lung epithelial cells in quantitative RT-PCR and western blot assays. The miR-200 family and these potential targets are functionally involved in canonical pathways of immune response, molecular mechanisms of cancer, metastasis signaling, cell-cell communication, proliferation and DNA repair in Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA). These results indicate that re-expression of miR-200 downregulates our previously identified NSCLC prognostic biomarkers in metastatic NSCLC cells. These results provide new insights into miR-200 regulation in lung cancer metastasis and consequent clinical outcome, and may provide a potential basis for innovative therapeutic approaches for the treatment of this deadly disease.

23710316	Title	miR-197 Expression in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from Hepatitis B Virus-Infected Patients.
23710316	Abstract	This study aimed to investigate the microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infected patients with different clinical manifestations and to analyze the function of miR-197. PBMC miRNA expression profiles in 51 healthy controls, 70 chronic asymptomatic carriers, 107 chronic hepatitis B patients, and 76 HBV-related acute on chronic liver failure patients were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). miR-197 mimic and inhibitor were transfected in THP-1 cells. qRT-PCR and ELISA for interleukin (IL)-18 mRNA and protein levels were performed, respectively. The microarray analysis revealed that 17 PBMC miRNA expression profiles (12 miRNAs downregulated and five miRNAs upregulated) differed significantly in HBV-induced liver disease patients presenting with various symptoms. The qRT-PCR results suggested that the PBMC miR-197 levels regularly decreased as the severity of liver disease symptoms became aggravated. IL-18, a key regulator in inflammation and immunity, was inversely correlated with miR-197 levels. Bioinformatic analysis indicated that IL-18 was a target of miR-197. Exogenous expression of miR-197 could significantly repress IL-18 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in THP-1 cells. We concluded that multiple PBMC miRNAs had differential expression profiles during HBV infection and that miR-197 may play an important role in the reactivation of liver inflammation by targeting IL-18.

23714355	Title	Deregulated expression of miR-145 in manifold human cancer cells.
23714355	Abstract	MicroRNAs play important roles in the processes of tumor initiation and progression. The expression level of miR-145 in gastric, liver, and cervical cancers has been rarely investigated. Whether miR-145 may function as a common tumor suppressor in the generation of tumor phenotype needs to be clarified. miR-145 expression was determined by RT-qPCR in various human cancer tissues including those of gastric, liver, colon, and cervical cancers. Cancer cell lines were transfected with miR-145 precursor, anti-miR-145 inhibitor, or negative control, and cells' proliferation, migration, and invasion activities were analyzed. The gene target of miR-145 was confirmed by luciferase assay and Western blot. The miR-145 expression level was lower by 37.68-, 2.64-, 2.69- and 2.39-fold in gastric, liver, colon, and cervical cancer tissues, respectively, compared to corresponding nontumorous controls. Moreover, miR-145 levels were significantly downregulated in various cancer cell lines. We further demonstrated that miR-145 could suppress anchorage-independent growth and cell motility in both the liver cancer cell line Hep-G2 and the gastric cancer cell line MKN-45, and inhibited cell proliferation in a cell type-specific manner. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) was identified as a target gene of miR-145, by which miR-145 was able to suppress cell proliferation. miR-145 suppresses cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, cell motility, and may serve as a tumor suppressor.

23717581	Title	miR-506 regulates epithelial mesenchymal transition in breast cancer cell lines.
23717581	Abstract	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important parameter related to breast cancer survival. Among several microRNAs predicted to target EMT-related genes, miR-506 is a novel miRNA found to be significantly related to breast cancer patient survival in a meta-analysis. miR-506 suppressed the expression of mesenchymal genes such as Vimentin, Snai2, and CD151 in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell line. Moreover, NF-KappaB bound to the upstream promoter region of miR-506 to suppress transcription. Overexpression of miR-506 inhibited TGFBeta-induced EMT and suppressed adhesion, invasion, and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells. From these results, we concluded that miR-506 plays a key role in the process of EMT through posttranslational control of EMT-related genes.

23717629	Title	Decreased microRNA is involved in the vascular remodeling abnormalities in chronic kidney disease (CKD).
23717629	Abstract	Patients with CKD have abnormal vascular remodeling that is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) control mRNA expression intracellularly and are secreted into the circulation; three miRNAs (miR-125b, miR-145 and miR-155) are known to alter vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and differentiation. We measured these vascular miRNAs in blood from 90 patients with CKD and found decreased circulating levels with progressive loss of eGFR by multivariate analyses. Expression of these vascular miRNAs miR-125b, miR-145, and miR-155 was decreased in the thoracic aorta in CKD rats compared to normal rats, with concordant changes in target genes of RUNX2, angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R), and myocardin. Furthermore, the expression of miR-155 was negatively correlated with the quantity of calcification in the aorta, a process known to be preceded by vascular de-differentiation in these animals. We then examined the mechanisms of miRNA regulation in primary VSMC and found decreased expression of miR-125b, 145, and 155 in VSMC from rats with CKD compared to normal littermates but no alteration in DROSHA or DICER, indicating that the low levels of expression is not due to altered intracellular processing. Finally, overexpression of miR-155 in VSMC from CKD rats inhibited AT1R expression and decreased cellular proliferation supporting a direct effect of miR-155 on VSMC. In conclusion, we have found ex vivo and in vitro evidence for decreased expression of these vascular miRNA in CKD, suggesting that alterations in miRNAs may lead to the synthetic state of VSMC found in CKD. The decreased levels in the circulation may reflect decreased vascular release but more studies are needed to confirm this relationship.

23721824	Title	Upregulation of miR-370 contributes to the progression of gastric carcinoma via suppression of FOXO1.
23721824	Abstract	FOXO1 is downregulated in a number of cancers. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we report that the expression of miR-370 was upregulated in gastric cancer cell lines and gastric cancer tissues. Overexpression of miR-370 in gastric cancer cells promoted the cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth, while silencing of miR-370 showed opposite effects. miR-370-induced proliferation was correlated with the downregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p27(Kip1) and p21(Cip1), and the upregulation of the cell cycle regulator cyclin D1. Furthermore, we identified that FOXO1 is the functional target of miR-370. Restored expression of FOXO1 together with miR-370 strongly abrogated miR-370-induced cell proliferation. Taken together, our results revealed a novel mechanism of FOXO1 suppression mediated by miR-370 in gastric cancer.

23724042	Title	Association of a genetic variation in a miR-191 binding site in MDM4 with risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
23724042	Abstract	As an oncoprotein, MDM4 plays a key part in P53 tumor suppressor pathway through negatively regulating P53 function. It has been reported that an rs4245739 A>C polymorphism locating in the MDM4 3'-untranslated region creates a miR-191 target site and results in decreased MDM4 expression. Therefore, we investigated the association between this polymorphism and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) risk as well as its biological function in vivo. Genotypes were determined in two independent case-control sets consisted of 1128 ESCC cases and 1150 controls from two regions of China. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by logistic regression. The impact of the polymorphism on MDM4 expression was examined with esophagus tissues. Our results demonstrated that the MDM4 rs4245739 AC and CC genotypes were significantly associated with decreased ESCC risk compared with the AA genotype in both case-control sets (Jinan set: OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.35-0.82, P = 0.004; Huaian set: OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.45-0.99, P = 0.049). Stratified analyses revealed that a multiplicative interaction between rs4245739 and smoking or drinking was evident (Gene-smoking: P(interactioin) = 0.022; gene-drinking: P(interactioin) = 0.032). After detecting In vivo MDM4 mRNA expression, we found that the rs4245739 AC and CC genotype carriers had significantly decreased MDM4 expression in normal esophagus tissues compared with AA genotype carriers, indicating a consistent genotype-phenotype correlation. Our results elucidate that the MDM4 rs4245739 polymorphism contributes to susceptibility of ESCC and support the hypothesis that genetic variants, interrupting miRNA-mediated gene regulation, may modify cancer risk.

23733368	Title	MicroRNA-146 represses endothelial activation by inhibiting pro-inflammatory pathways.
23733368	Abstract	Activation of inflammatory pathways in the endothelium contributes to vascular diseases, including sepsis and atherosclerosis. We demonstrate that miR-146a and miR-146b are induced in endothelial cells upon exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines. Despite the rapid transcriptional induction of the miR-146a/b loci, which is in part mediated by EGR-3, miR-146a/b induction is delayed and sustained compared to the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules, and in fact coincides with the down-regulation of inflammatory gene expression. We demonstrate that miR-146 negatively regulates inflammation. Over-expression of miR-146a blunts endothelial activation, while knock-down of miR-146a/b in vitro or deletion of miR-146a in mice has the opposite effect. MiR-146 represses the pro-inflammatory NF-KappaB pathway as well as the MAP kinase pathway and downstream EGR transcription factors. Finally, we demonstrate that HuR, an RNA binding protein that promotes endothelial activation by suppressing expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), is a novel miR-146 target. Thus, we uncover an important negative feedback regulatory loop that controls pro-inflammatory signalling in endothelial cells that may impact vascular inflammatory diseases.

23734217	Title	MicroRNA-449a is downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer and inhibits migration and invasion by targeting c-Met.
23734217	Abstract	MicroRNA-449a is expressed at a low level in several tumors and cancer cell lines, and induces G1 arrest, apoptosis, and senescence. To identify the function of miR-449a in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we discussed the potential relevance of miR-449a to clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis in NSCLC. We also investigated the impact of miR-449a on migration and invasion in NSCLC cells. The expression of miR-449a in NSCLC tissues and cell lines was detected using RT-qPCR. In vitro, gain-of-function, loss-of-function experiments, and fluorescence assays were performed to identify the potential target of miR-449a and the function of miR-449a in NSCLC cells. MiR-449a was downregulated in both NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Moreover, a low expression level of miR-449a appeared to be correlated with lymph node metastasis and poor survival. In vitro, miR-449 regulated cell migration and invasion in NSCLC cells as a potential tumor suppressor, at least in part by targeting c-Met. Furthermore, reciprocal expression of miR-449a and c-Met was shown in NSCLC tissue samples. This study indicates that miR-449a might be associated with NSCLC progression, and suggests a crucial role for miR-449a in NSCLC.

23735840	Title	SUZ12 depletion suppresses the proliferation of gastric cancer cells.
23735840	Abstract	SUZ12 and EZH2 are two main components of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) that is known to be of great importance in tumorigenesis. EZH2 has been reported to play a vital role in pathogenesis of human cancer. However, whether SUZ12 has equivalent roles in tumorigenesis has not been demonstrated. Here, we investigated a possible role of SUZ12 for the proliferation of gastric cancer cells. Western-blot analysis was used to detected the levels of SUZ12, H3K27me3, EZH2 and p27 in ten gastric cell lines. SUZ12 was depleted by RNA interference. Cell cycle was detected by flow cytometry. Luciferase assays was to analyze whether miR-200b directly regulate SUZ12. We found that SUZ12 depletion mediated by RNA interference (RNAi) led to a reduction of gastric cell numbers and arrested the cell cycle at G1/S point. As an important G1/S phase inhibitory gene, p27 is re-induced to some extent by SUZ12 knockdown. Furthermore, we demonstrated that SUZ12 was directly downregulated by miR-200b. We provide evidence suggesting that SUZ12 may be a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer.

23752185	Title	miR-27a regulates endothelial differentiation of breast cancer stem like cells.
23752185	Abstract	Recent studies suggested that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are capable of differentiating into endothelial cells and tumor endothelium may be derived from CSCs. But the mechanism remains unclear. We showed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) induced the expression of endothelial markers in breast cancer stem like cells (BCSLCs). In addition, the VEGF-treated BCSLCs formed capillary structure in matrigel and released vWF upon histamine treatment. The miR-27a expression was significantly increased in VEGF-treated BCSLCs. Antagonizing miR-27a by miR-27a anti-sense oligos (ASOs) in VEGF-treated BCSLCs led to decreased endothelial markers and function, while increasing miR-27a in BCSLCs resulted in enhanced endothelial properties. VEGF enhanced the transcription of miR-27a by increasing RUNX1 binding to miR-27a promoter. Increased miR-27a paralleled the reduced expression of ZBTB10, a known miR-27a target. Both expression of miR-27a and knockdown of ZBTB10 in BCSLCs promoted in vivo angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. Further, we demonstrated that VEGF-treated BCSLCs secreted more endogenous VEGF compared with undifferentiated BCSLCs. Thus, miR-27a promotes angiogenesis by mediating endothelial differentiation of BCSLCs and it may be a new target for anti-angiogenesis cancer therapy.

23752186	Title	EVI1 oncogene promotes KRAS pathway through suppression of microRNA-96 in pancreatic carcinogenesis.
23752186	Abstract	Despite frequent KRAS mutation, the early molecular mechanisms of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) development have not been fully elucidated. By tracking a potential regulator of another feature of PDAC precursors, acquisition of foregut or gastric epithelial gene signature, we herein report that aberrant overexpression of ecotropic viral integration site 1 (EVI1) oncoprotein, which is usually absent in normal pancreatic duct, is a widespread marker across the full spectrum of human PDAC precursors and PDAC. In pancreatic cancer cells, EVI1 depletion caused remarkable inhibition of cell growth and migration, indicating its oncogenic roles. Importantly, we found that EVI1 upregulated KRAS expression through suppression of a potent KRAS suppressor, miR-96, in pancreatic cancer cells. Collectively, the present findings suggest that EVI1 overexpression and KRAS mutation converge on activation of the KRAS pathway in early phases of pancreatic carcinogenesis and propose EVI1 and/or miR-96 as early markers and therapeutic targets in this dismal disease.

23755214	Title	Role of miR-142-3p in the post-transcriptional regulation of the clock gene Bmal1 in the mouse SCN.
23755214	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that function as post-transcriptional modulators by regulating stability or translation of target mRNAs. Recent studies have implicated miRNAs in the regulation of mammalian circadian rhythms. To explore the role of miRNAs in the post-transcriptional modulation of core clock genes in the master circadian pacemaker, we examined miR-142-3p for evidence of circadian expression in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), regulation of its putative clock gene target Bmal1 via specific binding sites in the 3' UTR and overexpression-induced changes in the circadian rhythm of BMAL1 protein levels in SCN cells. In mice exposed to constant darkness (DD), miR-142-3p levels in the SCN were characterized by circadian rhythmicity with peak expression during early subjective day at CT 3. Mutagenesis studies indicate that two independent miRNA recognition elements located at nucleotides 1-7 and 335-357 contribute equally to miR-142-3p-induced repression of luciferase-reported Bmal1 3' UTR activity. Importantly, overexpression of miR-142-3p in immortalized SCN cells abolished circadian variation in endogenous BMAL1 protein levels in vitro. Collectively, our results suggest that miR-142-3p may play a role in the post-transcriptional modulation of Bmal1 and its oscillatory regulation in molecular feedback loops mediating SCN circadian function.

23758992	Title	BCL11A overexpression predicts survival and relapse in non-small cell lung cancer and is modulated by microRNA-30a and gene amplification.
23758992	Abstract	Aberrant activation of the proto-oncogene B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11A (BCL11A) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of leukemia and lymphoma. However, the clinical significance of BCL11A in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unknown. We examined BCL11A expression at the protein and mRNA levels in a cohort (n=114) of NSCLC patients and assessed the relationship between BCL11A expression and clinicopathological parameters. Data from array-based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) and microRNA transfection experiments were integrated to explore the potential mechanisms of abnormal BCL11A activation in NSCLC. Compared to adjacent non-cancerous lung tissues, BCL11A expression levels were specifically upregulated in NSCLC tissues at both the mRNA (t=9.81, P<0.001) and protein levels. BCL11A protein levels were higher in patients with squamous histology (Chi2=15.81, P=0.001), smokers (Chi2=8.92, P=0.004), patients with no lymph node involvement (Chi2=5.14, P=0.029), and patients with early stage disease (Chi2=3.91, P=0.048). A multivariate analysis demonstrated that in early stage NSCLC (IA-IIB), BCL11A was not only an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival (hazards ratio [HR] 0.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.12-0.50, P<0.001), but also for overall survival (HR=0.23, 95% CI 0.09-0.61, P=0.003). The average BCL11A expression level was much higher in SCC samples with amplifications than in those without amplifications (t=3.30, P=0.023). Assessing functionality via an in vitro luciferase reporter system and western blotting, we found that the BCL11A protein was a target of miR-30a. Our results demonstrated that proto-oncogene BCL11A activation induced by miR-30a and gene amplification may be a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for effective management of this disease.

23768087	Title	MiR-204 down regulates SIRT1 and reverts SIRT1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition, anoikis resistance and invasion in gastric cancer cells.
23768087	Abstract	Our previous studies showed that SIRT1 was over-expressed in gastric cancer specimens and related with lymph node metastasis. However, the mechanism of SIRT1 up-regulation and its association with metastasis in gastric cancer remain unclear. The present study was undertaken to understand the role of microRNA in regulation of SIRT1 in the progression of gastric cancer. Expression of miR-204 and SIRT1 was assessed in two gastric cancer cell lines and 24 matched cancer specimens. Luciferase reporter assay was carried to verify that miR-204 targeting SIRT1. Cell invasion ability of AGS and BGC was detected by transwell invasion assay. Annexin V/PI assay was used to investigate the cell sensitivity of anoikis. Western blot analysis to assess SIRT1, Vimentin, E-Cadherin, LKB1, and Beta-actin expression was performed in gastic cancer cell lines. SIRT1 was defined as the target gene and elucidated the biological functions of miR-204 with a luciferase reporter assay and Western blot analysis. We verified that miR-204 levels were down-regulated and significantly associated with the up-regulation of SIRT1 mRNA levels in gastric cancer specimens. Over-expression of miR-204 reduced cell invasion and anoikis resistance in gastric cancer cells. Up-regulation of miR-204 influenced the levels of the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated genes, increasing E-cadherin levels and decreasing Vimentin levels. We demonstrated that the regulation of EMT by miR-204 involves cooperation with LKB1. Furthermore, silencing of SIRT1 phenocopied the effects of miR-204 in gastric cancer cells. These data demonstrate that miR-204 plays an important role in regulating metastasis of gastric cancer, which is involved in post-transcriptional repression of SIRT1. Our results suggest that down-regulation of miR-204 promotes gastric cancer cell invasion by activating the SIRT1-LKB1 pathway. These data demonstrate that miR-204 plays an important role in regulating metastasis of gastric cancer, which is involved in post-transcriptional repression of SIRT1.

23770851	Title	MiR-221 promotes the development of androgen independence in prostate cancer cells via downregulation of HECTD2 and RAB1A.
23770851	Abstract	Hormone-sensitive prostate cancer typically progresses to castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) after the androgen deprivation therapy. We investigated the impact of microRNAs (miRs) in the transition of prostate cancer to CRPC. MiR-221/-222 was highly expressed in bone metastatic CRPC tumor specimens. We previously demonstrated that transient overexpression of miR-221/-222 in LNCaP promoted the development of the CRPC phenotype. In current study, we show that stably overexpressing miR-221 confers androgen independent (AI) cell growth in LNCaP by rescuing LNCaP cells from growth arrest at G1 phase due to the lack of androgen. Overexpressing of miR-221 in LNCaP reduced the transcription of a subgroup of androgen-responsive genes without affecting the androgen receptor (AR) or AR-androgen integrity. By performing systematic biochemical and bioinformatical analyses, we identified two miR-221 targets, HECTD2 and RAB1A, which could mediate the development of CRPC phenotype in multiple prostate cancer cell lines. Downregulation of HECTD2 significantly affected the androgen-induced and AR-mediated transcription, and downregulation of HECTD2 or RAB1A enhances AI cell growth. As a result of the elevated expression of miR-221, expression of many cell cycle genes was altered and pathways promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition/tumor metastasis were activated. We hypothesize that a major biological consequence of upregulation of miR-221 is reprogramming of AR signaling, which in turn may mediate the transition to the CRPC phenotype.

23770886	Title	Identification of LIN28B-bound mRNAs reveals features of target recognition and regulation.
23770886	Abstract	The conserved human LIN28 RNA-binding proteins function in development, maintenance of pluripotency and oncogenesis. We used PAR-CLIP and a newly developed variant of this method, iDo-PAR-CLIP, to identify LIN28B targets as well as sites bound by the individual RNA-binding domains of LIN28B in the human transcriptome at nucleotide resolution. The position of target binding sites reflected the known structural relative orientation of individual LIN28B-binding domains, validating iDo-PAR-CLIP. Our data suggest that LIN28B directly interacts with most expressed mRNAs and members of the let-7 microRNA family. The Lin28-binding motif detected in pre-let-7 was enriched in mRNA sequences bound by LIN28B. Upon LIN28B knockdown, cell proliferation and the cell cycle were strongly impaired. Quantitative shotgun proteomics of LIN28B depleted cells revealed significant reduction of protein synthesis from its RNA targets. Computational analyses provided evidence that the strength of protein synthesis reduction correlated with the location of LIN28B binding sites within target transcripts.

23778488	Title	MicroRNA 100: a context dependent miRNA in prostate cancer.
23778488	Abstract	MicroRNAs are noncoding RNA molecules involved in the development and progression of tumors. We have found that miRNA-100 is underexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer compared to localized disease. Conversely higher levels of miR-100 are related to biochemical recurrence after surgery. This suggests that miR-100 may be a context-dependent miRNA, acting as oncogene or tumor suppressor miRNA. Our aim is to demonstrate the role of miR-100 in the control of predicted target genes in prostate cancer cell lines. Cell lines DU145 and PC3 were transfected with miR-100, antimiR-100 and after 24 h and 48 h of exposure, qRT-PCR and western blot were performed for mTOR, FGFR3, THAP2, SMARCA5 and BAZ2A. There was reduction in mTOR (p=0.025), THAP2 (p=0.038), SMARCA5 (p=0.001) and BAZ2A (p=0.006) mRNA expression in DU145 cells after exposure to miR-100. In PC3 cells, mTOR expression was decreased by miR-100 (p=0.01). There was a reduction in the expression levels of proteins encoded by studied genes, ranging from 34% to 69%. We demonstrate that miR-100 is a context-dependent miRNA controlling BAZ2, mTOR, FGFR3, SMARCA5 and THAP2 that might be involved in PC progression. The elucidation of the roles of miRNAs in tumors is important because they can be used as therapeutic targets in the future.

23778499	Title	Tumor-targeted Chlorotoxin-coupled Nanoparticles for Nucleic Acid Delivery to Glioblastoma Cells: A Promising System for Glioblastoma Treatment.
23778499	Abstract	The present work aimed at the development and application of a lipid-based nanocarrier for targeted delivery of nucleic acids to glioblastoma (GBM). For this purpose, chlorotoxin (CTX), a peptide reported to bind selectively to glioma cells while showing no affinity for non-neoplastic cells, was covalently coupled to liposomes encapsulating antisense oligonucleotides (asOs) or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The resulting targeted nanoparticles, designated CTX-coupled stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALPs), exhibited excellent features for in vivo application, namely small size (<180 nm) and neutral surface charge. Cellular association and internalization studies revealed that attachment of CTX onto the liposomal surface enhanced particle internalization into glioma cells, whereas no significant internalization was observed in noncancer cells. Moreover, nanoparticle-mediated miR-21 silencing in U87 human GBM and GL261 mouse glioma cells resulted in increased levels of the tumor suppressors PTEN and PDCD4, caspase 3/7 activation and decreased tumor cell proliferation. Preliminary in vivo studies revealed that CTX enhances particle internalization into established intracranial tumors. Overall, our results indicate that the developed targeted nanoparticles represent a valuable tool for targeted nucleic acid delivery to cancer cells. Combined with a drug-based therapy, nanoparticle-mediated miR-21 silencing constitutes a promising multimodal therapeutic approach towards GBM.Molecular Therapy-Nucleic Acids (2013) 2, e100; doi:10.1038/mtna.2013.30; published online 18 June 2013.

23778527	Title	Hypoxia regulates FGFR3 expression via HIF-1Alpha and miR-100 and contributes to cell survival in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.
23778527	Abstract	Non-muscle invasive (NMI) bladder cancer is characterised by increased expression and activating mutations of FGFR3. We have previously investigated the role of microRNAs in bladder cancer and have shown that FGFR3 is a target of miR-100. In this study, we investigated the effects of hypoxia on miR-100 and FGFR3 expression, and the link between miR-100 and FGFR3 in hypoxia. Bladder cancer cell lines were exposed to normoxic or hypoxic conditions and examined for the expression of FGFR3 by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and western blotting, and miR-100 by qPCR. The effect of FGFR3 and miR-100 on cell viability in two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) was examined by transfecting siRNA or mimic-100, respectively. In NMI bladder cancer cell lines, FGFR3 expression was induced by hypoxia in a transcriptional and HIF-1Alpha-dependent manner. Increased FGFR3 was also in part dependent on miR-100 levels, which decreased in hypoxia. Knockdown of FGFR3 led to a decrease in phosphorylation of the downstream kinases mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (PKB), which was more pronounced under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, transfection of mimic-100 also decreased phosphorylation of MAPK and PKB. Finally, knocking down FGFR3 profoundly decreased 2-D and 3-D cell growth, whereas introduction of mimic-100 decreased 3-D growth of cells. Hypoxia, in part via suppression of miR-100, induces FGFR3 expression in bladder cancer, both of which have an important role in maintaining cell viability under conditions of stress.

23784029	Title	MiR-21/Smad 7 signaling determines TGF-Beta1-induced CAF formation.
23784029	Abstract	How TGF-Beta1-mediated signaling pathways are finely tuned to orchestrate the generation of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that miR-21 and the signaling of its target Smad 7 determine TGF-Beta1-induced CAF formation. In primary cultured fibroblasts, mature miR-21 increases after TGF-Beta1 treatment, whereas the Smad 7 protein level decreases. MiR-21 binds to the 3' UTR of Smad7 mRNA and inhibits its translation, rather than causing its degradation. Most importantly, Smad 7 is bound to Smad 2 and 3, which are thought to competitively bind to TGFBR1, and prevents their activation upon TGF-Beta1 stimulation. The depletion of miR-21 or the overexpression of Smad 7 blocks TGF-Beta1-induced CAF formation, whereas the overexpression of miR-21 or the depletion of Smad 7 promotes CAF formation, even without TGF-Beta1 stimulation. Collectively, these findings clearly demonstrate that miR-21 and Smad7 are critical regulators of TGF-Beta1 signaling during the induction of CAF formation.

23785404	Title	miR-23a targets interferon regulatory factor 1 and modulates cellular proliferation and paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in gastric adenocarcinoma cells.
23785404	Abstract	MicroRNAs are a class of non-coding RNAs that function as key regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In our previous research, we found that miR-23a was significantly up-regulated in human gastric adenocarcinoma cells. In the current study, we demonstrate that miR-23a suppresses paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and promotes the cell proliferation and colony formation ability of gastric adenocarcinoma cells. We have identified tumor suppressor interferon regulator factor 1 (IRF1) as a direct target gene of miR-23a. We performed a fluorescent reporter assay to confirm that miR-23a bound to the IRF1 mRNA 3'UTR directly and specifically. The ectopic expression of IRF1 markedly promoted paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and inhibited cell viability and colony formation ability, whereas the knockdown of IRF1 had the opposite effects. The restoration of IRF1 expression counteracted the effects of miR-23a on the paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and cell proliferation of gastric adenocarcinoma cells. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that miR-23a is frequently up-regulated in gastric adenocarcinoma tissues, whereas IRF1 is down-regulated in cancer tissues. Altogether, these results indicate that miR-23a suppresses paclitaxel-induced apoptosis and promotes cell viability and the colony formation ability of gastric adenocarcinoma cells by targeting IRF1 at the post-transcriptional level.

23788032	Title	CPEB1, a histone-modified hypomethylated gene, is regulated by miR-101 and involved in cell senescence in glioma.
23788032	Abstract	Epigenetic mechanisms have important roles in carcinogenesis. We certified that the mRNA translation-related gene cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 1 (CPEB1) is hypomethylated and overexpressed in glioma cells and tissues. The knockdown of CPEB1 reduced cell senescence by regulating the expression or distribution of p53 in glioma cells. CPEB1 is also regulated directly by the tumor suppressor miR-101, a potential marker of glioma. It is known that the histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) and embryonic ectoderm development (EED) are direct targets of miR-101. We demonstrated that miR-101 downregulated the expression of CPEB1 through reversing the methylation status of the CPEB1 promoter by regulating the presence on the promoter of the methylation-related histones H3K4me2, H3K27me3, H3K9me3 and H4K20me3. The epigenetic regulation of H3K27me3 on CPEB1 promoter is mediated by EZH2 and EED. EZH2 has a role in the regulation of H3K4me2. Furthermore, the downregulation of CPEB1 induced senescence in a p53-dependent manner.

23790975	Title	Posttranscriptional deregulation of Src due to aberrant miR34a and miR203 contributes to gastric cancer development.
23790975	Abstract	Gastric cancer remains the main cause of cancer death all around the world, and upregulated activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase c-SRC (SRC) is a key player in the development. In this study, we found that expression of Src is also increased in clinical gastric cancer samples, with the protein level increased more significantly than that at the RNA level. Further study revealed that miR34a and miR203, two tumor suppressive miRNAs, inversely correlate with the expression of Src. Restoration of miR34a and miR203 decreased Src expression in gastric cancer cell lines, which in turn inhibited cell growth and cell migration. In summary, our study here revealed that posttranscriptional regulation of Src contributes to the deregulated cell growth and metastasis in gastric cancer, and targeting Src by miR34a or miR203 mimics would be a promising strategy in therapy.

23794009	Title	miR-146a polymorphism influences levels of miR-146a, IRAK-1, and TRAF-6 in young patients with coronary artery disease.
23794009	Abstract	Modulation of nuclear factor KappaB (NF-KappaB) activation may play a role in regulating inflammatory conditions associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). MicroRNA-146a (miR-146a) primarily targets interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) and tumour necrosis factor receptor associated factor 6 (TRAF-6), which results in inhibition of NF-KappaB via the TLR pathway. This study investigated the influence of the miR-146a GC rs2910164 on miR-146a expression in young South African Indians with CAD. CAD patients and controls were genotyped by PCR-RFLP and miRNA-146a levels were measured by qPCR. IRAK-1, TRAF-6 and NF-KappaB expression was determined by Western blot. No differences in genotypic frequency was found (GG: 45 vs. 47%, GC: 46 vs. 41%, CC: 9 vs. 12%) in controls and patients respectively (odds ratio = 1.025; 95% confidence interval 0.6782-1.550; p = 0.9164). Significantly higher levels of miR-146a was associated with CAD patients with the CC genotype (6.25-fold increase relative to controls and patients with the wildtype variant, p < 0.0001). Significantly lower levels of IRAK-1 (0.38 +- 0.02; p = 0.0072) and TRAF-6 (0.44 +- 0.02; p = 0.0146) was found in CAD patients with the CC genotype. The lowest levels of NF-KappaB and C-reactive protein were found in patients with the homozygous C allele compared to the heterozygous GC and wildtype variants. We propose a role for miR-146a in TLR signalling through a negative feedback mechanism involving the attenuation of NF-KappaB by down-regulation of IRAK-1 and TRAF-6. Our observations implicate miR-146a as a target for lowering inflammation in CAD patients.

23794145	Title	MicroRNA-212 inhibits proliferation of gastric cancer by directly repressing retinoblastoma binding protein 2.
23794145	Abstract	Retinoblastoma binding protein 2 (RBP2), a newly found histone demethylase, is overexpressed in gastric cancer. We examined the upstream regulatory mechanism of RBP2 at the microRNA (miRNA) level and the role in gastric carcinogenesis. We used bioinformatics to predict that microRNA-212 (miR-212) might be a direct upstream regulator of RBP2 and verified the regulation in gastric epithelial-derived cell lines. Overexpression of miR-212 significantly inhibited the expression levels of RBP2, whereas knockdown of miR-212 promoted RBP2 expression. Furthermore, we identified the putative miR-212 targeting sequence in the RBP2 3' UTR by luciferase assay. MiR-212 inhibited the colony formation ability of cells by repressing RBP2 expression and increasing that of P21(CIP1) and P27(kip1), both critical in cell cycle arrest. In addition, the expression of RBP2 and miR-212 in tumor tissue and matched normal tissue from 18 patients further supported the results in vivo. MiR-212 directly regulates the expression of RBP2 and inhibits cell growth in gastric cancer, which may provide new clues to treatment.

23794259	Title	Circulating miR-22, miR-24 and miR-34a as novel predictive biomarkers to pemetrexed-based chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.
23794259	Abstract	Pemetrexed has been widely used in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The clinical relevance of polymorphisms of folate pathway genes for pemetrexed metabolism have not been fully elucidated yet. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression levels of circulating miR-22, miR-24, and miR-34a, possibly involved in folate pathway, in NSCLC patients treated with pemetrexed compared with healthy controls and to investigate their impact on patient clinical outcomes. A total of 22 consecutive patients with advanced NSCLC, treated with pemetrexed-based chemotherapy and 27 age and sex matched healthy controls were included in this preliminary analysis. miR-22, miR-24, and miR-34a targets were identified by TargetScan 6.2 algorithm, validating the involvement of these microRNAs in folate pathway. MicroRNAs were isolated from whole blood and extracted with miRNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). miRNA profiling was performed using Real-Time PCR. SPSS 17 was used to data analysis. miR-22, miR-24, and miR-34a were found upregulated (P<0.05) in NSCLC patients versus healthy controls. Higher expression levels were recorded for miR-34a. Nevertheless, significantly higher miR-22 expression was observed in patients developing progressive disease (P=0.03). No significant associations with clinical outcome were recorded for miR-24 and miR-34a. Albeit preliminary, these data support the involvement of miR-22, miR-24, and miR-34a in advanced NSCLC. The correlation between high expression of miR-22 in whole blood and the lack of response in pemetrexed treated NSCLC patients indicates that miR-22 could represent a novel predictive biomarker for pemetrexed-based treatment.

23797610	Title	Differential expression of dicer, miRNAs, and inflammatory markers in diabetic Ins2+/- Akita hearts.
23797610	Abstract	Diabetic cardiomyopathy is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and Insulin2 mutant (Ins2+/-) Akita is a genetic mice model of diabetes relevant to humans. Dicer, miRNAs, and inflammatory cytokines are associated with heart failure. However, the differential expression of miRNAs, dicer, and inflammatory molecules are not clear in diabetic cardiomyopathy of Akita. We measured the levels of miRNAs, dicer, pro-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFAlpha), and anti-inflammatory interleukin 10 (IL-10) in C57BL/6J (WT) and Akita hearts. The results revealed increased heart to body weight ratio and robust expression of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP: a hypertrophy marker) suggesting cardiac hypertrophy in Akita. The multiplex RT-PCR, qPCR, and immunoblotting showed up regulation of dicer, whereas miRNA array elicited spread down regulation of miRNAs in Akita including dramatic down regulation of let-7a, miR-130, miR-142-3p, miR-148, miR-338, miR-345-3p, miR-384-3p, miR-433, miR-450, miR-451, miR-455, miR-494, miR-499, miR-500, miR-542-3p, miR-744, and miR-872. Conversely, miR-295 is induced in Akita. Cardiac TNFAlpha is upregulated at mRNA (RT-PCR and qPCR), protein (immunoblotting), and cellular (immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy) levels, and is robust in hypertrophic cardiomyocytes suggesting direct association of TNFAlpha with hypertrophy. Contrary to TNFAlpha, cardiac IL-10 is downregulated in Akita. In conclusion, induction of dicer and TNFAlpha, and attenuation of IL-10 and majority of miRNA are associated with cardiomyopathy in Akita and could be used for putative therapeutic target for heart failure in diabetics.

23799049	Title	Distinctive profile of IsomiR expression and novel microRNAs in rat heart left ventricle.
23799049	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate target gene expression through mRNA cleavage or translational repression. There is mounting evidence that they play critical roles in heart disease. The expression of known miRNAs in the heart has been studied at length by microarray and quantitative PCR but it is becoming evident that microRNA isoforms (isomiRs) are potentially physiologically important. It is well known that left ventricular (patho)physiology is influenced by transmural heterogeneity of cardiomyocyte phenotype, and this likely reflects underlying heterogeneity of gene expression. Given the significant role of miRNAs in regulating gene expression, knowledge of how the miRNA profile varies across the ventricular wall will be crucial to better understand the mechanisms governing transmural physiological heterogeneity. To determinine miRNA/isomiR expression profiles in the rat heart we investigated tissue from different locations across the left ventricular wall using deep sequencing. We detected significant quantities of 145 known rat miRNAs and 68 potential novel orthologs of known miRNAs, in mature, mature* and isomiR formation. Many isomiRs were detected at a higher frequency than their canonical sequence in miRBase and have different predicted targets. The most common miR-133a isomiR was more effective at targeting a construct containing a sequence from the gelsolin gene than was canonical miR-133a, as determined by dual-fluorescence assay. We identified a novel rat miR-1 homolog from a second miR-1 gene; and a novel rat miRNA similar to miR-676. We also cloned and sequenced the rat miR-486 gene which is not in miRBase (v18). Signalling pathways predicted to be targeted by the most highly detected miRNAs include Ubiquitin-mediated Proteolysis, Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase, Regulation of Actin Cytoskeleton, Wnt signalling, Calcium Signalling, Gap junctions and Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy. Most miRNAs are not expressed in a gradient across the ventricular wall, with exceptions including miR-10b, miR-21, miR-99b and miR-486.

23799849	Title	MicroRNA profiles classify papillary renal cell carcinoma subtypes.
23799849	Abstract	Besides the conventional clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), papillary RCC (pRCC) is the second most common renal malignancy. Papillary RCCs can further be subdivided into two distinct subtypes. Although a clinical relevance of pRCC subtyping has been shown, little is known about the molecular characteristics of both pRCC subtypes. We performed microarray-based microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling of primary ccRCC and pRCC cases. A subset of miRNAs was identified and used to establish a classification model for ccRCC, pRCC types 1 and 2 and normal tissue. Furthermore, we performed gene set enrichment analysis with the predicted miRNA target genes. Only five miRNAs (miR-145, -200c, -210, -502-3p and let-7c) were sufficient to identify the samples with high accuracy. In a collection of 111 tissue samples, 73.9% were classified correctly. An enrichment of miRNA target genes in the family of multidrug-resistance proteins was noted in all tumours. Several components of the Jak-STAT signalling pathway might be targets for miRNAs that define pRCC tumour subtypes. MicroRNAs are able to accurately classify RCC samples. Deregulated miRNAs might contribute to the high chemotherapy resistance of RCC. Furthermore, our results indicate that pRCC type 2 tumours could be dependent on oncogenic MYC signalling. 

23799850	Title	miR-320c regulates gemcitabine-resistance in pancreatic cancer via SMARCC1.
23799850	Abstract	Gemcitabine-based chemotherapy is the standard treatment for pancreatic cancer. However, the issue of resistance remains unresolved. The aim of this study was to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that govern the resistance to gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer. miRNA microarray analysis using gemcitabine-resistant clones of MiaPaCa2 (MiaPaCa2-RGs), PSN1 (PSN1-RGs), and their parental cells (MiaPaCa2-P, PSN1-P) was conducted. Changes in the anti-cancer effects of gemcitabine were studied after gain/loss-of-function analysis of the candidate miRNA. Further assessment of the putative target gene was performed in vitro and in 66 pancreatic cancer clinical samples. miR-320c expression was significantly higher in MiaPaCa2-RGs and PSN1-RGs than in their parental cells. miR-320c induced resistance to gemcitabine in MiaPaCa2. Further experiments showed that miR-320c-related resistance to gemcitabine was mediated through SMARCC1, a core subunit of the switch/sucrose nonfermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex. In addition, clinical examination revealed that only SMARCC1-positive patients benefited from gemcitabine therapy with regard to survival after recurrence (P=0.0463). The results indicate that miR-320c regulates the resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine through SMARCC1, suggesting that miR-320c/SMARCC1 could be suitable for prediction of the clinical response and potential therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer patients on gemcitabine-based therapy.

23800944	Title	miR-874 Inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion through targeting aquaporin-3 in gastric cancer.
23800944	Abstract	Aquaporin-3 (AQP3) is a water transporting protein which plays an oncogenic role in several malignant tumors. However, its regulatory mechanism remains elusive to date. In this study, we investigated the microRNA-mediated gene repression mechanism involved in AQP3's role. The potential microRNAs targeting AQP3 were searched via bioinformatic methods and identified by luciferase reporter assays, microRNA RT-PCR and western blotting. The expression patterns of miR-874 and AQP3 in human gastric cancer (GC) specimens and cell lines were determined by microRNA RT-PCR and western blotting. 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, cell migration and invasion assays and tumorigenicity in vivo were adopted to observe the effects of miR-874 depletion or ectopic miR-874 expression on GC cell phenotypes. Cell apoptosis was evaluated by FACS and TUNEL in vitro and in vivo respectively. miR-874 suppressed AQP3 expression by binding to the 3'UTR of AQP3 mRNA in GC cells. miR-874 was significantly down-regulated and reversely correlated with AQP3 protein levels in clinical samples. Analysis of the clinicopathological significance showed that miR-874 and AQP3 were closely correlated with GC characteristics. Functional analyses indicated that ectopic miR-874 expression suppressed the growth, migration, invasion and tumorigenicity of GC cells, whereas miR-874 knockdown promoted these phenotypes. Down-regulation of Bcl-2, MT1-MMP, MMP-2 and MMP-9 and upregulation of caspase-3 activity and Bax were involved in miR-874 inducing cell apoptosis, and inhibiting migration and invasion. These results provide a mechanism by which AQP3 is upregulated, as well as highlight the importance of miR-874 in gastric cancer development and progression.

23801157	Title	MiR-335, an adipogenesis-related microRNA, is involved in adipose tissue inflammation.
23801157	Abstract	During the development of obesity, adipose tissue releases a host of different adipokines and inflammatory cytokines, such as leptin, resistin, tumor necrosis factor Alpha (TNF-Alpha), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and adiponectin, which mediate insulin resistance. Recently, some microRNAs (miRNAs) regulated by adiponectin were identified as novel targets for controlling adipose tissue inflammation. Therefore, the relationship between adipokines and miRNA is worth studying. MiR-335 is an adipogenesis-related miRNA and implicated in both fatty acid metabolism and lipogenesis. In this study, we focused on the association of miR-335 and adipokines, and examined the expression trend of miR-335 during human adipocyte differentiation. Our results showed that miR-335 is significantly upregulated with treatment of leptin, resistin, TNF-Alpha, and IL-6 in human mature adipocytes, and its expression elevated in the process of adipocyte differentiation. Interestingly, the transcriptional regulation of miR-335 by these adipokines seems independent of its host gene (mesoderm-specific transcript homolog, MEST). Thus, we cloned and identified potential promoter of miR-335 within the intron of MEST. As a result, a fragment about 600-bp length upstream sequences of miR-335 had apparent transcription activity. These findings indicated a novel role for miR-335 in adipose tissue inflammation, and miR-335 might play an important role in the process of obesity complications via its own transcription mechanism.

23803041	Title	Effects of microRNA-106 on proliferation of gastric cancer cell through regulating p21 and E2F5.
23803041	Abstract	To investigate the effects of miR-106b on malignant characteristics of gastric cancer cells, and explore possible mechanisms. Expression of miR-106b, p21 and E2F was determined by real-time PCR. Transfection with miR-106b mimics was conducted, and gastric cancer cells with miR-106b overexpression were obtained. Cells transfected with mimic mutants and those without transfection served as negative and blank controls, respectively. Flow cytometry and transwell assays were adopted to detect the effects of miR-106b overexpression on cell cycle, migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. . The expression of miR- 106b in gastric cancer cells was significantly higher than that in normal gastric mucosa cells. Furthermore, the expression level of miR-106b rose according to the degree of malignacy among the three GC cell strains (MKN- 45 > SGC-7901 > MKN-28). Overexpression of miR-106b shortened the G0/G1 phase and accelerated cell cycle progression, while reducing p21 and E2F5, without any significant effects on the capacity for migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. miR-106b may promote cell cycling of gastric cancer cells through regulation of p21 and E2F5 target gene expression.

23806108	Title	Let-7b expression determines response to chemotherapy through the regulation of cyclin D1 in glioblastoma.
23806108	Abstract	Glioblastoma is the most common type of primary brain tumors. Cisplatin is a commonly used chemotherapeutic agent for Glioblastoma patients. Despite a consistent rate of initial responses, cisplatin treatment often develops chemoresistance, leading to therapeutic failure. Cellular resistance to cisplatin is of great concern and understanding the molecular mechanisms is an utter need. Glioblastoma cell line U251 cells were exposed to increasing doses of cisplatin for 6 months to establish cisplatin-resistant cell line U251R. The differential miRNA expression profiles in U251 and U251R cell lines were identified by microarray analysis and confirmed by Q-PCR. MiRNA mimics were transfected into U251R cells, and cellular response to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were examined by FACS analysis. U251R cells showed 3.1-fold increase in cisplatin resistance compared to its parental U251 cells. Microarray analysis identified Let-7b and other miRNAs significantly down-regulated in U251R cells compared to U251 cells. Transfection of Let-7b mimics greatly re-sensitized U251R cells to cisplatin, while transfection of other miRNAs has no effect or slightly effect. Cyclin D1 is predicted as a target of Let-7b through bioinformatics analysis. Over-expression of Let-7b mimics suppressed cyclin D1 protein expression and inhibited cyclin D1-3'-UTR luciferase activity. Knockdown of cyclin D1 expression significantly increased cisplatin-induced G1 arrest and apoptosis. Collectively, our results indicated that cisplatin treatment leads to Let-7b suppression, which in turn up-regulates cyclin D1 expression. Let-7b may serve as a marker of cisplatin resistance, and can enhance the therapeutic benefit of cisplatin in glioblastoma cells.

23806972	Title	Targeted delivery of miR-200c/DOC to inhibit cancer stem cells and cancer cells by the gelatinases-stimuli nanoparticles.
23806972	Abstract	Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are recently discovered as vital obstacles for the successful cancer therapy. Emerging evidences suggest that miR-200c functions as an effective CSCs inhibitor and can restore sensitivity to microtubule-targeting drugs. In the present work, the intelligent gelatinases-stimuli nanoparticles (NPs) was set up to co-deliver miR-200c and docetaxel (DOC) to verify their synergetic effects on inhibition of CSCs and non-CSC cancer cells. After tumor cells were treated with miR-200c NPs, miR-200c and its targeted gene class III beta-tubulin (TUBB3)TUBB3 expression were evaluated. The effects of miR-200c/DOC NPs on tumor cell viability, migration and invasion as well as the expression of E-cadherin and CD44 were studied. The antitumor effects of miR-200c/DOC NPs were compared with DOC NPs in xenograft gastric cancer mice. Moreover, the residual tumors after treatment were subcutaneously seeded into nude mice to further investigate the effective maintenance of NPs. We found that the gelatinases-stimuli NPs facilitated miR-200c into cells, achieving sustained miR-200c expression in tumor cells during 9 days. The miR-200c/DOC NPs significantly enhanced cytotoxicity of DOC, possibly by decreasing TUBB3 level, and reversing EMT. The miR-200c NPs achieved high levels of in vivo accumulation and long retention in gastric cancer xenografts after intravenous administration. The miR-200c/DOC NPs prominently suppressed in vivo tumor growth with elevated miR-200c and E-cadherin levels and down-regulated TUBB3 and CD44 expressions. When the residual tumors after miR-200c/DOC NPs treatment were re-transplanted into nude mice, the tumors demonstrated the slowest growth speed. The miR-200c/DOC NPs may provide a promising modality for co-delivery of nucleic acid and drugs to simultaneously inhibit CSCs and non-CSC cancer cells.

23818228	Title	The ZEB1 pathway links glioblastoma initiation, invasion and chemoresistance.
23818228	Abstract	Glioblastoma remains one of the most lethal types of cancer, and is the most common brain tumour in adults. In particular, tumour recurrence after surgical resection and radiation invariably occurs regardless of aggressive chemotherapy. Here, we provide evidence that the transcription factor ZEB1 (zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 1) exerts simultaneous influence over invasion, chemoresistance and tumourigenesis in glioblastoma. ZEB1 is preferentially expressed in invasive glioblastoma cells, where the ZEB1-miR-200 feedback loop interconnects these processes through the downstream effectors ROBO1, c-MYB and MGMT. Moreover, ZEB1 expression in glioblastoma patients is predictive of shorter survival and poor Temozolomide response. Our findings indicate that this regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition orchestrates key features of cancer stem cells in malignant glioma and identify ROBO1, OLIG2, CD133 and MGMT as novel targets of the ZEB1 pathway. Thus, ZEB1 is an important candidate molecule for glioblastoma recurrence, a marker of invasive tumour cells and a potential therapeutic target, along with its downstream effectors.

23819653	Title	Fine-tuning of microRNA-mediated repression of mRNA by splicing-regulated and highly repressive microRNA recognition element.
23819653	Abstract	MicroRNAs are very small non-coding RNAs that interact with microRNA recognition elements (MREs) on their target messenger RNAs. Varying the concentration of a given microRNA may influence the expression of many target proteins. Yet, the expression of a specific target protein can be fine-tuned by alternative cleavage and polyadenylation to the corresponding mRNA. This study showed that alternative splicing of mRNA is a fine-tuning mechanism in the cellular regulatory network. The splicing-regulated MREs are often highly repressive MREs. This phenomenon was observed not only in the hsa-miR-148a-regulated DNMT3B gene, but also in many target genes regulated by hsa-miR-124, hsa-miR-1, and hsa-miR-181a. When a gene contains multiple MREs in transcripts, such as the VEGF gene, the splicing-regulated MREs are again the highly repressive MREs. Approximately one-third of the analysable human MREs in MiRTarBase and TarBase can potentially perform the splicing-regulated fine-tuning. Interestingly, the high (+30%) repression ratios observed in most of these splicing-regulated MREs indicate associations with functions. For example, the MRE-free transcripts of many oncogenes, such as N-RAS and others may escape microRNA-mediated suppression in cancer tissues. This fine-tuning mechanism revealed associations with highly repressive MRE. Since high-repression MREs are involved in many important biological phenomena, the described association implies that splicing-regulated MREs are functional. A possible application of this observed association is in distinguishing functionally relevant MREs from predicted MREs.

23820254	Title	STAT3 upregulates miR-92a to inhibit RECK expression and to promote invasiveness of lung cancer cells.
23820254	Abstract	Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation is frequently found in human lung cancer and is associated with increased metastasis and reduced survival. How STAT3 enhances invasiveness is unclear. The expression of microRNAs and target genes was measured by real-time RT-PCR. Protein level was studied by western blotting. Luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the direct targeting of microRNAs. Gelatin zymography was used to study matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity. Transwell assay was used to investigate cell migration and invasion. Enforced expression of STAT3 decreases the endogenous MMP inhibitor RECK protein but not mRNA level in H460 cells. Conversely, STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 increases RECK protein in STAT3-activating H1299 cells. We demonstrate that STAT3 upregulates miR-92a to repress RECK via post-transcriptional inhibition. The RECK 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) reporter activity assay suggests that RECK is a direct repression target of miR-92a. Delivery of pre-miR-92a reduces RECK protein level whereas transfection of anti-miR-92a restores STAT3-induced downregulation of RECK. Anti-miR-92a attenuates MMP activity, migration and invasion of H1299 cells and STAT3-overexpressing H460 cells, suggesting miR-92a is critical for STAT3-induced invasiveness. The STAT3-induced miR-92a promotes cancer invasion by suppressing RECK and targeting of the STAT3/miR-92a axis may be helpful for cancer treatment.

23821457	Title	MicroRNA-200c regulates the sensitivity of chemotherapy of gastric cancer SGC7901/DDP cells by directly targeting RhoE.
23821457	Abstract	Gastric cancer remains a worldwide burden as the second leading cause of cancer-related death. Drug resistance of chemotherapy looms as a major clinical obstacle to successful treatment. Recent evidence indicated that miRNA-200c can restore the sensitivity of NSCLC cells to cisplatin and cetuximab. The expression of miRNA-200c and RhoE were investigated in gastric cancer tissues and cells (SGC7901 and SGC7901/DDP) by qRT-PCR. A luciferase reporter assay was done to understand the potential correlation between miRNA-200c and RhoE. Pre-miR-200c was transfected in SGC7901/DDP cells to confirm whether miRNA-200c could regulate RhoE expression. RhoE was knocked down to explore the role of RhoE on sensitivity of chemotherapy in gastric cancer by MTT. Western blot analysis was performed to further explore the mechanism of RhoE in regulating drug resistance. The results showed that miRNA-200c was significantly lower in cancerous tissues than those in the paired normal tissues, whereas the expression of RhoE was just the opposite. The significant difference of miRNA-200c and RhoE were observed between SGC7901 cells and SGC7901/DDP cells. miRNA-200c has target sites in the 3'-UTR of RhoE mRNA by luciferase reporter assay. Transfection of pre-miR-200c reduces RhoE expression. Meanwhile, the knockdown of RhoE enhanced the sensitivity of SGC7901/DDP cells and changed expression of some genes. These suggested that miRNA-200c regulated the sensitivity of chemotherapy to cisplatin (DDP) in gastric cancer by possibly targeting RhoE.

23821519	Title	MiR-503 regulates osteoclastogenesis via targeting RANK.
23821519	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. However, no study has investigated the role of miRNA in postmenopausal osteoporosis. Here, we report that miR-503 was markedly reduced in circulating progenitors of osteoclasts-CD14(+) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from postmenopausal osteoporosis patients compared with those from postmenopausal healthy women. Overexpression of miR-503 in CD14(+) PBMCs inhibited receptor activator of nuclear factor-KappaB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis. Conversely, silencing of miR-503 in CD14(+) PBMCs promoted osteoclastogenesis. RANK, which is activated by the binding of RANKL and inducing osteoclast differentiation, was confirmed to be a target of miR-503. In vivo, silencing of miR-503 using a specific antagomir in ovariectomy (OVX) mice increased RANK protein expression, promoted bone resorption, and decreased bone mass, whereas overexpression of miR-503 with agomir inhibited bone resorption and prevented bone loss in OVX mice. Thus, our study revealed that miR-503 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis and contributes to a new therapeutic way for osteoporosis.

23824713	Title	miR-134 induces oncogenicity and metastasis in head and neck carcinoma through targeting WWOX gene.
23824713	Abstract	Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a prevalent disease worldwide, and the survival of HNSCC has not improved significantly over the last few decades. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have an important regulatory role during carcinogenesis. Our study investigated the pathogenic implications of miR-134 in head and neck carcinogenesis. The clinicopathologic implications of miR-134 in HNSCC were investigated using expression assays and the functional role of miR-134 in HNSCC pathogenesis was determined using ectopic expression, knockdown and reporter assay experiments. Xenographic tumorigenesis and orthotopic nodal metastasis were assayed in mouse models. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expression of miR-134 and the WWOX gene in human HNSCC. The results indicated that miR-134 was upregulated in HNSCC tissues relative to control mucosa. High expression of miR-134 was associated with nodal metastasis and mortality of patients. Decreased plasma miR-134 levels after tumor ablation indicated a better prognosis for patients. Multivariate analysis showed that high miR-134 expression in HNSCC was an independent predictor of poor survival. Ectopic miR-134 expression significantly enhanced in vitro oncogenic phenotypes and the orthotopic growth and metastasis of HNSCC cells. miR-134 targeted WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) gene and cell invasion enhanced by miR-134 expression was abrogated by ectopic WWOX expression in HNSCC cells. miR-134 expression was reversely associated with the WWOX expression in HNSCC tissues. Evidences from our study substantiated that miR-134 expression contributes to head and neck carcinogenesis by targeting the WWOX.

23826132	Title	Epigenetic silencing of miR-338-3p contributes to tumorigenicity in gastric cancer by targeting SSX2IP.
23826132	Abstract	MicroRNA has been recently recognized as playing a prominent role in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Here, we report that miR-338-3p was epigenetically silenced in gastric cancer, and its down-regulation was significantly correlated with gastric cancer clinicopathological features. Strikingly, restoring miR-338-3p expression in SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells inhibited proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo, at least partly through inducing apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the oncogene SSX2IP is a target of miR-338-3p. We propose that miR-338-3p functions as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, and the methylation status of its CpG island could serve as a potential diagnostic marker for gastric cancer.

23834902	Title	MiR-214 regulate gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting PTEN.
23834902	Abstract	MicroRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNAs that play an important role in various human tumor initiation and progression by regulating gene expression negatively. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of miR-214 on cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as the functional connection between miR-214 and PTEN in gastric cancer. miR-214 and PTEN expression was determined in gastric cancer and matched normal tissues, and human gastric cancer cell lines by quantitative real-time PCR. The roles of miR-214 in cell proliferation, migration and invasion were analyzed with anti-miR-214 transfected cells. In addition, the regulation of PTEN by miR-214 was evaluated by Western blotting and luciferase reporter assays. miR-214 was noted to be highly overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines using qRT-PCR. The expression level of miR-214 is significantly associated with clinical progression and poor prognosis according to the analysis of the clinicopathologic data. We also found that the miR-214 levels are inversely correlated with PTEN in tumor tissues. And PTEN expression level is also associated with metastasis and invasion of gastric cancer. In addition, knockdown of miR-214 could significantly inhibit proliferation, migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that PTEN is regulated negatively by miR-214 through a miR-214 binding site within the 3'-UTR of PTEN at the posttranscriptional level in gastric cancer cells. These findings indicated that miR-214 regulated the proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting PTEN post-transcriptionally in gastric cancer. It may be a novel potential therapeutic agent for gastric cancer.

23835407	Title	miR-375 targets the p53 gene to regulate cellular response to ionizing radiation and etoposide in gastric cancer cells.
23835407	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) offer a new approach for molecular classification and individual therapy of human cancer due to their regulation of oncogenic pathways. In a previous report, elevated miR-375 was found in recurring gastric cancer, and it was predicted that miR-375 may be a regulator of p53 gene. However, its biological role and mechanism of actions remain unknown. In this study, we characterized the expression level of miR-375 in gastric cancer cell lines--BGC823, MGC803, SGC7901, AGS, N87, MKN45--using RT-PCR. We found that exogenous expression of miR-375 promoted the growth of AGS cells in both liquid and soft agar media. In agreement with the previous report, overexpression of miR-375 in AGS cells reduced the p53 protein expression level. A luciferase assay demonstrated that miR-375 down-regulated p53 expression through an interaction with the 3' UTR region of p53. In addition, the expression of miR-375 desensitizes cells to ionizing radiation and etoposide. Flow cytometry analyses showed that miR-375 abrogated the cell cycle arrest and apoptosis after DNA damage. These results demonstrate that miR-375 targets p53 to regulate the response to ionizing radiation and etoposide treatment.

23844087	Title	TLR3-induced placental miR-210 down-regulates the STAT6/interleukin-4 pathway.
23844087	Abstract	Several clinical studies have reported increased placental miR-210 expression in women with PE compared to normotensive women, but whether miR-210 plays a role in the etiology of PE is unknown. We reported that activation of TLR3 produces the PE-like symptoms of hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, and proteinuria in mice only when pregnant, but whether TLR3 activation in pregnant mice and human cytotrophoblasts (CTBs) increases miR-210 and modulates its targets related to inflammation are unknown. Placental miR-210 levels were increased significantly in pregnant mice treated with the TLR3 agonist poly I:C (P-PIC). Both HIF-1Alpha and NF-KappaBp50, known to bind the miR-210 promoter and induce its expression, were also increased significantly in placentas of P-PIC mice. Target identification algorithms and gene ontology predicted STAT6 as an inflammation-related target of miR-210 and STAT6 was decreased significantly in placentas of P-PIC mice. IL-4, which is regulated by STAT6 and increases during normotensive pregnancy, failed to increase in serum of P-PIC mice. P-PIC TLR3 KO mice did not develop hypertension and placental HIF-1Alpha, NF-KappaBp50, miR-210, STAT6, and IL-4 levels were unchanged. To determine the placental etiology, treatment of human CTBs with poly I:C significantly increased HIF-1Alpha, NF-KappaBp50, and miR-210 levels and decreased STAT6 and IL-4 levels. Overexpression of miR-210 in CTBs decreased STAT6 and IL-4 while inhibition of miR-210 increased STAT6 and IL-4. These findings demonstrate that TLR3 activation induces placental miR-210 via HIF-1Alpha and NF-KappaBp50 leading to decreased STAT6 and IL-4 levels and this may contribute to the development of PE.

23846337	Title	GKN1-miR-185-DNMT1 axis suppresses gastric carcinogenesis through regulation of epigenetic alteration and cell cycle.
23846337	Abstract	Gastrokine 1 (GKN1) functions to protect the gastric antral mucosa and promotes healing by facilitating restoration and proliferation after injury. GKN1 is downregulated in Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells and loss of GKN1 expression is closely associated with gastric carcinogenesis, but underlying mechanisms of the tumor-suppressing effects of GKN1 remain largely unknown. AGS, MKN1, MKN28 gastric cancer cells and HFE-145 immortalized non-neoplastic gastric mucosal cells were transfected with GKN1 or shGKN1. We conducted molecular and functional studies of GKN1 and miR-185 and investigated the mechanisms of alteration. We also analyzed epigenetic alterations in 80 gastric cancer tissues. Restoration of GKN1 protein suppressed gastric cancer cell growth by inducing endogenous miR-185 that directly targets epigenetic effectors DNMT1 and EZH2 in gastric cancer cells. In addition, ectopic expression of GKN1 upregulated Tip60 and downregulated HDAC1 in an miR-185-independent manner, thereby inducing cell-cycle arrest by regulating cell-cycle proteins in gastric cancer cells. Notably, GKN1 expression was inversely correlated with DNMT1 and EZH2 expression in a subset of 80 gastric cancer tissues and various gastric cancer cell lines. Interestingly, it was found that GKN1 exerted a synergistic anti-cancerous effect with 5-fluorouracil on tumor cell growth, which suggests a possible therapeutic intervention method for gastric cancer. Our results show that GKN1 has an miR-185-dependent and -independent mechanism for chromatic and DNA epigenetic modification, thereby regulating the cell cycle. Thus, the loss of GKN1 function contributes to malignant transformation and proliferation of gastric epithelial cells in gastric carcinogenesis.

23847440	Title	Loop nucleotide polymorphism in a putative miRNA precursor associated with seed length in rice (Oryza sativa L.).
23847440	Abstract	The terminal loop region of primary miRNA transcripts is an important determinant controlling miRNA function in human, animals and plants. However, the effects of polymorphisms in loop region of miRNA precusors on phenotypic variation have not been reported, especially on agronomic traits in rice. From rice japonica variety Koshihikari and indica Guichao2, we isolated a precursor of putative miRNA osa-MIR2923a. We detected a GG/AA polymorphism in the loop structure from japonica and indica rice varieties, which was corresponding to japonica/indica rice differentiation. By using high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis, we measured the polymorphisms in a RIL (recombinant inbred lines) population derived from japonica variety Koshihikari and indica Guichao2. We found that the GG/AA polymorphism in the osa-MIR2923a loop was correlated to grain length and length-width ratio. We further found the significant association between seed length and GG/AA polymorphism in a population consisting of 72 rice landraces. Three targets were predicted, whose expressions showed significant differences between the two varieties. Our results suggested that the putative miRNA precursor and the three target genes could play functional roles for indica/japonica seed differentiation.

23851184	Title	Diallyl disulfide suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis in human gastric cancer through Wnt-1 signaling pathway by up-regulation of miR-200b and miR-22.
23851184	Abstract	The purpose of this study was to identify a mechanism related to miRNA pathway which plays a role in the anti-tumor effects of Diallyl disulfide. Alterations in miRNA expression were observed in Diallyl disulfide-treated MGC-803 cells, including up-regulation of miR-200b and miR-22 expression. Furthermore, Wnt-1 was identified as a target of both miR-200b and miR-22. MiR-200b and miR-22 not only synergistically inhibited gastric cancer growth, but also enhanced the antitumor effect of Diallyl disulfide both in vitro and in vivo. It indicated that miR-200b and miR-22 may serve as potential gene therapy and enhance Diallyl disulfide antitumor effects.

23857984	Title	The TAL1 complex targets the FBXW7 tumor suppressor by activating miR-223 in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
23857984	Abstract	The oncogenic transcription factor TAL1/SCL is aberrantly expressed in 60% of cases of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and initiates T-ALL in mouse models. By performing global microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling after depletion of TAL1, together with genome-wide analysis of TAL1 occupancy by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to massively parallel DNA sequencing, we identified the miRNA genes directly controlled by TAL1 and its regulatory partners HEB, E2A, LMO1/2, GATA3, and RUNX1. The most dynamically regulated miRNA was miR-223, which is bound at its promoter and up-regulated by the TAL1 complex. miR-223 expression mirrors TAL1 levels during thymic development, with high expression in early thymocytes and marked down-regulation after the double-negative-2 stage of maturation. We demonstrate that aberrant miR-223 up-regulation by TAL1 is important for optimal growth of TAL1-positive T-ALL cells and that sustained expression of miR-223 partially rescues T-ALL cells after TAL1 knockdown. Overexpression of miR-223 also leads to marked down-regulation of FBXW7 protein expression, whereas knockdown of TAL1 leads to up-regulation of FBXW7 protein levels, with a marked reduction of its substrates MYC, MYB, NOTCH1, and CYCLIN E. We conclude that TAL1-mediated up-regulation of miR-223 promotes the malignant phenotype in T-ALL through repression of the FBXW7 tumor suppressor.

23861222	Title	Inhibitions of epithelial to mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cells-like properties are involved in miR-148a-mediated anti-metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma.
23861222	Abstract	The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and acquisition of cancer stem cells (CSCs)-like properties are essential steps in the metastasis and postsurgical recurrence of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). The molecular mechanisms involved, however, remain obscure. As determined by an miRNA microarray analysis, there was lower expression of miR-148a in poorly differentiated HCC tissues relative to well-differentiated HCC tissues. MHCC97H and MHCC97L (HCC cells with migratory capacity) and HCC tissues with various differentiation status were selected for further investigation. The results showed that miR-148a levels inversely correlated with the differentiation status of HCC tissues. In MHCC97H and MHCC97L cells, over-expression of miR-148a blocked the EMT process, attenuated the expression of CD90 and CD44 (biomarkers for liver cancer stem cells), and inhibited their migratory capacity. Via TargetScan and microRNA.org algorithms, miR-148a was predicted to bind to the Wnt1 mRNA 3'-UTR. Wnt1 was confirmed as a target gene of miR-148a in HCC cells, and the Wnt signal pathway was determined to be involved in the miR-148a-mediated inhibition of EMT and CSCs-like properties of MHCC97H cells. Moreover, the expression of miR-148a in nonmetastatic HCC tissues was higher than that in metastatic HCC tissues. The results suggest that miR-148a inhibits the metastasis of HCCs by blocking EMT and CSCs-like properties through effects on the Wnt signaling pathway.

23861444	Title	A versatile microsatellite instability reporter system in human cells.
23861444	Abstract	Here, we report the investigation of microsatellite instability (MSI) in human cells with a newly developed reporter system based on fluorescence. We composed a vector into which microsatellites of different lengths and nucleotide composition can be introduced between a functional copy of the fluorescent protein mCherry and an out-of-frame copy of EGFP; in vivo frameshifting will lead to EGFP expression, which can be quantified by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS). Via targeted recombineering, single copy reporters were introduced in HEK293 and MCF-7 cells. We found predominantly -1 and +1 base pair frameshifts, the levels of which are kept in tune by mismatch repair. We show that tract length and composition greatly influences MSI. In contrast, a tracts' potential to form a G-quadruplex structure, its strand orientation or its transcriptional status is not affecting MSI. We further validated the functionality of the reporter system for screening microsatellite mutagenicity of compounds and for identifying modifiers of MSI: using a retroviral miRNA expression library, we identified miR-21, which targets MSH2, as a miRNA that induces MSI when overexpressed. Our data also provide proof of principle for the strategy of combining fluorescent reporters with next-generation sequencing technology to identify genetic factors in specific pathways.

23861821	Title	MicroRNA-196b regulates the homeobox B7-vascular endothelial growth factor axis in cervical cancer.
23861821	Abstract	The down-regulation of microRNA-196b (miR-196b) has been reported, but its contribution to cervical cancer progression remains to be investigated. In this study, we first demonstrated that miR-196b down-regulation was significantly associated with worse disease-free survival (DFS) for cervical cancer patients treated with combined chemo-radiation. Secondly, using a tri-modal approach for target identification, we determined that homeobox-B7 (HOXB7) was a bona fide target for miR-196b, and in turn, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was a downstream transcript regulated by HOXB7. Reconstitution of miR-196b expression by transient transfection resulted in reduced cell growth, clonogenicity, migration and invasion in vitro, as well as reduced tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation in vivo. Concordantly, siRNA knockdown of HOXB7 or VEGF phenocopied the biological effects of miR-196b over-expression. Our findings have demonstrated that the miR-196b/HOXB7/VEGF pathway plays an important role in cervical cancer progression; hence targeting this pathway could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the future management of this disease.

23862015	Title	hsa-miR29b, a critical downstream target of non-canonical Wnt signaling, plays an anti-proliferative role in non-small cell lung cancer cells via targeting MDM2 expression.
23862015	Abstract	In non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, activation of Beta-catenin independent signaling, via Wnt7a/Frizzled9 signaling, leads to reversal of cellular transformation, reduced anchorage-independent growth and induction of epithelial differentiation. miRNA expression profiling on a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A549) identified hsa-miR29b as an important downstream target of Wnt7a/Frizzled9 signaling. We show herein that hsa-miR29b expression is lost in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and stimulation of Beta-catenin independent signaling, via Wnt7a expression, in NSCLC cell lines results in increased expression of hsa-miR29b. Surprisingly, we also identify specific regulation of hsa-miR29b by Wnt7a but not by Wnt3, a ligand for Beta-catenin-dependent signaling. Interestingly, knockdown of hsa-miR29b was enough to abrogate the tumor suppressive effects of Wnt7a/Frizzled9 signaling in NSCLC cells, suggesting that hsa-miR29b is an important mediator of Beta-catenin independent signaling. Finally, we show for the first time that hsa-miR29b plays an important role as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer by targeting murine double mutant 2 (MDM2), revealing novel nodes for Wnt7a/Frizzled9-mediated regulation of NSCLC cell proliferation.

23862748	Title	MicroRNA-34a targets Bcl-2 and sensitizes human hepatocellular carcinoma cells to sorafenib treatment.
23862748	Abstract	MiR-34a, a direct target of p53, has been shown to target several molecules associated with the cell cycle and cell survival pathways, and its dysregulation is implicated in cancer drug resistance or sensitivity in several human cancers. However, the correlation between miR-34a expression and chemoresistance has not been explored in HCC. In this study, we confirmed that miR-34a was significantly down-regulated in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines by qRT-PCR. HCC tissues with lower miR-34a expression displayed higher expression of Bcl-2 protein than those with high expression of miR-34a; therefore, an inverse correlation is evident between the miR-34a level and Bcl-2 expression. Moreover, patients with lower miR-34a expression had significantly poorer overall survival. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays revealed that miR-34a binds the 3'-UTR of the Bcl-2 mRNA and represses its translation. Western blotting analysis and qRT-PCR confirmed that Bcl-2 is inhibited by miR-34a overexpression. Functional analyses indicated that the restoration of miR-34a reduced cell viability, promoted cell apoptosis and potentiated sorafenib-induced apoptosis and toxicity in HCC cell lines by inhibiting Bcl-2 expression. This study is the first to demonstrate that miR-34a induces sensitivity to the anti-tumor effect of sorafenib in human HCC cells, suggesting a potential role of miR-34a in the treatment of HCC.

23866094	Title	The regulation of Toll-like receptor 2 by miR-143 suppresses the invasion and migration of a subset of human colorectal carcinoma cells.
23866094	Abstract	The Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-driven tissue response may promote neoangiogenesis and tumour growth by mechanisms that are poorly understood. We investigated the expression levels of TLR2 and associated-miRNAs in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) tissues and cell lines using real-time PCR, northern blotting and western blotting. Survival curver was generated by Log-Rank test and the role of TLR2 signalling in tumour invasion and migration was determined by transwell analysis kits. We observed that the tissues from CRC patients express relatively high levels of TLR2. Targeting TLR2 markedly reduces the invasion and migration of CRC cells. We also found that miR-143, a putative tumour suppressor that is down-regulated in CRC tissues, reduces the invasion and migration of CRC cells primarily via TLR2. Utilising a xenograft mouse model, we demonstrated that re-expression of miR-143 inhibits CRC cell colonisation in vivo. miR-143 blocks the TLR2 signalling pathway in human CRC cells. This knowledge may pave the way for new clinical applications utilising miR-143 mimics in the treatment of patients with CRC.

23866847	Title	MiRNA-329 targeting E2F1 inhibits cell proliferation in glioma cells.
23866847	Abstract	MicroRNAs have recently emerged as key regulators of cancers, miR-329 located on 14q32.31 is one of down-regulated miRNAs in glioma, but the function and molecular mechanisms of miR-329 in determining the malignant phenotype of human glioma are elusive. This study therefore was conducted to investigate the role of miR-329 in biological behaviors of human glioma LN18 and T98G cell lines and its molecular mechanisms. Nine patients with GBM were analyzed for the expression of miR-329 by quantitative RT-PCR. MiR-329 overexpression was established by transfecting miR-329 precursor into LN18 and T98G cells, and its effects on cell proliferation were studied using MTT assay, anchorage-independent growth ability assay, colony formation assays, Bromodeoxyuridine labeling and immunofluorescence.The effects of miR-329 on cell cycle were studied by flow cytometry. The target of miR-329 was determined by luciferase assays. The regulation of miR-329 on Akt pathway was determined by western blot. The E2F1 was identified as the target of miR-329. Overexpression of miR-329 blocked G1/S transition in LN18 and T98G cell lines, dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and the ability of colony formation. MiR-329 significantly decreased the phosphorylation levels of intracellular kinases Akt and expression of cyclin D1, but the expression of p21 was upregulated, cell growth was suppressed by inhibiting E2F1-mediated Akt pathway. MiR-329 may inhibit cell proliferation in human glioma cells through regulating E2F1-mediated suppression of Akt pathway.

23868977	Title	MiR-19b/20a/92a regulates the self-renewal and proliferation of gastric cancer stem cells.
23868977	Abstract	Human gastric cancers contain a population of gastric cancer stem cells (GCSCs) that can undergo self-renewal and multipotent differentiation. GCSCs can be enriched with EpCAM+/CD44+ gastric cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanisms controlling the balance of GCSC self-renewal and differentiation remain to be explored. Because miRNAs can regulate cancer cell fates, we compared miRNA expression in tumorspheric cancer cells enriched with GCSCs and more differentiated cells. We found that the miR-17-92 cluster members miR-19b, miR-20a and miR-92a were gradually reduced during the differentiation of GCSCs. Therefore, we speculated that miR-17-92 members might regulate the self-renewal ability of GCSCs. By downregulating miR-19b, miR-20a and miR-92a in EpCAM+/CD44+ GCSCs, or overexpressing them in EpCAM-/CD44- non-GCSC populations, we found that miR-19b, miR-20a and miR-92a could sustain the self-renewal function of GCSCs. Furthermore, we found that miR-19b, miR-20a and miR-92a could also promote the proliferation of gastric cancer cells. miR-17-92 targeted the E2F1 and HIPK1 proteins, which suppressed Wnt-Beta-catenin signaling. A real-time PCR analysis of miR-19b, miR-20a and miR-92a expression in 97 gastric cancer specimens suggested that miR-92a could be used as an independent prognostic factor in gastric cancer. This study showed that several members of the miR-17-92 cluster, miR-19b, miR-20a and miR-92a, might play important roles in the development of gastric cancer stem cells and that miR-92a has the potential to be used as a predictive prognostic marker in gastric cancer.

23869222	Title	MicroRNA-326 functions as a tumor suppressor in glioma by targeting the Nin one binding protein (NOB1).
23869222	Abstract	Malignant glioma is the most common type of primary brain tumor in adults, characterized by rapid tumor growth and infiltration of tumor cells throughout the brain. Alterations in the activity of the 26S proteasome have been associated with malignant glioma cells, although the specific defects have not been identified. Recently, microRNA-326 (miR-326) was shown to play an important role in glioblastoma and breast cancer, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, the human Nin one binding protein (NOB1) was identified as a direct target of miR-326 and a potential oncogene in human glioma. Similar to NOB1 silencing by shRNA, overexpression of miR-326 in human glioma cell lines (A172 and U373) caused cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, delayed cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis. MiR-326 inhibited colony formation in soft agar and decreased growth of a xenograft tumor model, suggesting that miR-326 and NOB1 are required for tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, these processes were shown to involve the MAPK pathway. NOB1 overexpression in human glioma samples was detected by Affymetrix array analysis, and NOB1 mRNA and protein levels were shown to be increased in high-grade glioma compared to low-grade glioma and normal brain tissue. Furthermore, high levels of NOB1 were associated with unfavorable prognosis of glioma patients. Taken together, these results indicate that miR-326 and NOB1 may play an important role in the development of glioma.

23873106	Title	microRNA-148a suppresses human gastric cancer cell metastasis by reversing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.
23873106	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gastric cancer development and progression. miR-148a is one of the most frequently and highly downregulated miRNAs in gastric cancer and is associated with advanced clinical stage and poor prognosis. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-148a in gastric cancer metastasis. Levels of miR-148a were determined by qRT-PCR in 60 gastric cancer samples. Cell migration and invasion assays were performed in a stably expressing miRNA-148a gastric cancer cell line established using a lentivirus expression system. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was evaluated using qRT-PCR and Western Blots to detect epithelial marker E-cadherin and mesenchymal marker, vimentin. Luciferase reporter assays were used to identify downstream targets and biological function of miR-148a. Gastric cancer tissue had significantly lower expression of miR-148a compared to non-tumor tissue. Low miR-148a levels were associated with lymph node metastasis, N stage, and blood vessel invasion. miR-148a overexpression inhibited metastasis of gastric cancer cells. miR-148a overexpression also downregulated vimentin expression and upregulated E-cadherin expression, suggesting that miR-148a inhibited EMT. Finally, the SMAD2 gene was identified as the direct and functional target of miR-148a. MiR-148a suppresses gastric cancer metastasis and EMT, likely via SMAD2. Restoration of miR-148a expression could have important implications in gastric cancer therapy.

23873704	Title	MicroRNA expression profile and functional analysis reveal that miR-382 is a critical novel gene of alcohol addiction.
23873704	Abstract	Alcohol addiction is a major social and health concern. Here, we determined the expression profile of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rats treated with alcohol. The results suggest that multiple miRNAs were aberrantly expressed in rat NAc after alcohol injection. Among them, miR-382 was down-regulated in alcohol-treated rats. In both cultured neuronal cells in vitro and in the NAc in vivo, we identified that the dopamine receptor D1 (Drd1) is a direct target gene of miR-382. Via this target gene, miR-382 strongly modulated the expression of DeltaFosB. Moreover, overexpression of miR-382 significantly attenuated alcohol-induced up-regulation of DRD1 and DeltaFosB, decreased voluntary intake of and preference for alcohol and inhibited the DRD1-induced action potential responses. The results indicated that miRNAs are involved in and may represent novel therapeutic targets for alcoholism.

23874225	Title	miR-133a regulates adipocyte browning in vivo.
23874225	Abstract	Prdm16 determines the bidirectional fate switch of skeletal muscle/brown adipose tissue (BAT) and regulates the thermogenic gene program of subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SAT) in mice. Here we show that miR-133a, a microRNA that is expressed in both BAT and SATs, directly targets the 3' UTR of Prdm16. The expression of miR-133a dramatically decreases along the commitment and differentiation of brown preadipocytes, accompanied by the upregulation of Prdm16. Overexpression of miR-133a in BAT and SAT cells significantly inhibits, and conversely inhibition of miR-133a upregulates, Prdm16 and brown adipogenesis. More importantly, double knockout of miR-133a1 and miR-133a2 in mice leads to elevations of the brown and thermogenic gene programs in SAT. Even 75% deletion of miR-133a (a1(-/-)a2(+/-) ) genes results in browning of SAT, manifested by the appearance of numerous multilocular UCP1-expressing adipocytes within SAT. Additionally, compared to wildtype mice, miR-133a1(-/-)a2(+/-) mice exhibit increased insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, and activate the thermogenic gene program more robustly upon cold exposure. These results together elucidate a crucial role of miR-133a in the regulation of adipocyte browning in vivo.

23874686	Title	Downregulation of microRNA-130a contributes to endothelial progenitor cell dysfunction in diabetic patients via its target Runx3.
23874686	Abstract	Dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) contributes to diabetic vascular disease. MicroRNAs (miRs) have emerged as key regulators of diverse cellular processes including angiogenesis. We recently reported that miR-126, miR-130a, miR-21, miR-27a, and miR-27b were downregulated in EPCs from type II diabetes mellitus (DM) patients, and downregulation of miR-126 impairs EPC function. The present study further explored whether dysregulated miR-130a were also related to EPC dysfunction. EPCs were cultured from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of diabetic patients and healthy controls. Assays on EPC function (proliferation, migration, differentiation, apoptosis, and colony and tubule formation) were performed. Bioinformatics analyses were used to identify the potential targets of miR-130a in EPCs. Gene expression of miR-103a and Runx3 was measured by real-time PCR, and protein expression of Runx3, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Akt was measured by Western blotting. Runx3 promoter activity was measured by luciferase reporter assay. A miR-130a inhibitor or mimic and lentiviral vectors expressing miR-130a, or Runx3, or a short hairpin RNA targeting Runx3 were transfected into EPCs to manipulate miR-130a and Runx3 levels. MiR-130a was decreased in EPCs from DM patients. Anti-miR-130a inhibited whereas miR-130a overexpression promoted EPC function. miR-130a negatively regulated Runx3 (mRNA, protein and promoter activity) in EPCs. Knockdown of Runx3 expression enhanced EPC function. MiR-130a also upregulated protein expression of ERK/VEGF and Akt in EPCs. In conclusion, miR-130a plays an important role in maintaining normal EPC function, and decreased miR-130a in EPCs from DM contributes to impaired EPC function, likely via its target Runx3 and through ERK/VEGF and Akt pathways.

23874837	Title	Overexpressed microRNA-182 promotes proliferation and invasion in prostate cancer PC-3 cells by down-regulating N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1).
23874837	Abstract	MicroRNAs, non-coding 20-22 nucleotide single-stranded RNAs, result in translational repression or degradation and gene silencing of their target genes, and significantly contribute to the regulation of gene expression. In the current study, we report that miR-182 expression was significantly upregulated in prostate cancer tissues and four cell lines, compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues and normal prostatic epithelial (RWPE-1) cells. Ectopic overexpression of miR-182 significantly promotes the proliferation, increases the invasion, promotes the G1/S cell cycle transition and reduces early apotosis of PC-3 cells, while suppression of miR-182 decreased the proliferation and invasion, inhibits the G1/S cell cycle transition and increase early apotosis of PC-3 cells. Additionally, we demonstrated that miR-182 could downregulate expression of NDRG1 by directly targeting the NDRG1 3'-untranslated region. In conclusion, our results suggest that miR-182 plays an important role in the proliferation of human prostate cancer cells by directly suppressing the tumor supressor gene NDRG1. We uncovered a new epigenetic regulation of NDRG1.

23874841	Title	MicroRNA-200a regulates Grb2 and suppresses differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into endoderm and mesoderm.
23874841	Abstract	The mechanisms by which microRNAs (miRNAs) affect cell fate decisions remain poorly understood. Herein, we report that miR-200a can suppress the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells into endoderm and mesoderm. Interestingly, miR-200a directly targets growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2), which is a key adaptor in the Erk signaling pathway. Furthermore, high levels of miR-200a dramatically decrease Grb2 levels and suppress the appearance of mesoderm and endoderm lineages in embryoid body formation, as well as suppressing the activation of Erk. Finally, Grb2 supplementation significantly rescues the miR-200a-induced layer-formation bias and the Erk suppression. Collectively, our results demonstrate that miR-200a plays critical roles in ES cell lineage commitment by directly regulating Grb2 expression and Erk signaling.

23876001	Title	MicroRNA-145 regulates oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 for selective killing of human non-small cell lung cancer cells.
23876001	Abstract	Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, and novel treatment modalities to improve the prognosis of patients with advanced disease are highly desirable. Oncolytic virotherapy is a promising approach for the treatment of advanced NSCLC. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may be a factor in the regulation of tumor-specific viral replication. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether miRNA-145 regulated oncolytic herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) can selectively kill NSCLC cells with reduced collateral damage to normal cells. We incorporated 4 copies of miRNA-145 target sequences into the 3'-untranslated region of an HSV-1 essential viral gene, ICP27, to create AP27i145 amplicon viruses and tested their target specificity and toxicity on normal cells and lung cancer cells in vitro. miRNA-145 expression in normal cells was higher than that in NSCLC cells. AP27i145 replication was inversely correlated with the expression of miRNA-145 in infected cells. This oncolytic HSV-1 selectively reduced cell proliferation and prevented the colony formation of NSCLC cells. The combination of radiotherapy and AP27i145 infection was significantly more potent in killing cancer cells than each therapy alone. miRNA-145-regulated oncolytic HSV-1 is a promising agent for the treatment of NSCLC.

23877371	Title	Downregulation of microRNA-182 inhibits cell growth and invasion by targeting programmed cell death 4 in human lung adenocarcinoma cells.
23877371	Abstract	Lung cancer is a major cause of cancer death worldwide. Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), an important tumor suppressor, influences transcription and translation of multiple genes and modulates different signal transduction pathways. However, the upstream regulation of this gene is largely unknown. In our study, we found that microRNA-182 (miR-182) was upregulated, whereas PDCD4 was downregulated in lung cancer cell lines. We performed methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium and colony formation assays to study the influence of miR-182 on proliferation of the lung cancer cell lines A549 and SPC-A-1. We also carried out Transwell and wound healing assays to investigate the effect of miR-182 on invasion and migration of A549 and SPC-A-1. Finally, using the luciferase reporter assay and restore assay, we demonstrated that PDCD4 is a direct target of miR-182. These results suggest that in lung adenocarcinoma cells, miR-182 plays an oncogenic role as a direct negative regulator of PDCD4.

23877787	Title	MicroRNA-29a regulates the benzo[a]pyrene dihydrodiol epoxide-induced DNA damage response through Cdc7 kinase in lung cancer cells.
23877787	Abstract	Cdc7 kinase is a key regulator of DNA replication and has an important role in the cellular DNA damage response by controlling checkpoint signaling and cell survival. Yet, how the activity of Cdc7 kinase is regulated is poorly understood. In silico analysis identified microRNA-29 (miR-29)-binding sites in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of both Cdc7 and its activating subunit Dbf4. We show that miR-29a binds to Cdc7 and Dbf4 3'-UTRs and regulates kinase levels. We find that in response to DNA damage, upregulation of Cdc7 kinase correlates with a downregulation in miR-29a. Enforced miR-29a expression prevents the accumulation of Cdc7 in response to the environmental genotoxin, benzo[a]pyrene dihydrodiol epoxide (BPDE) present in cigarette smoke, resulting in aberrant checkpoint signaling and increased cell lethality. As BPDE sensitivity was rescued by overexpression of miRNA-resistant Cdc7/Dbf4, we propose that Cdc7 kinase is an important target of miR-29a in determining cell survival from genotoxic stress caused by this environmental toxin.

23880861	Title	The Tumor Suppressor Roles of miR-433 and miR-127 in Gastric Cancer.
23880861	Abstract	The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) provides a new and powerful tool for studying the mechanism, diagnosis and treatment of human cancers. Currently, the methylation epigenetic silencing of miRNAs with tumor suppressor features by CpG island hypermethylation is emerging as a common hallmark of different tumors. Here we showed that miR-433 and miR-127 were significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer (GC) tissues compared with the adjacent normal regions in 86 paired samples. Moreover, the lower level of miR-433 and miR-127 was associated with pM or pTNM stage in clinical gastric cancer patients. The restored expression of miR-433 and miR-127 in GC cells upon 5-Aza-CdR and TSA treatment suggested the loss of miR-433 and miR-127 was at least partly regulated by epigenetic modification in GC. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of miR-433 and miR-127 in gastric cancer cell lines HGC-27 inhibits cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell migration and invasion by directly interacting with the mRNA encoding oncogenic factors KRAS and MAPK4 respectively. Taken together, our results showed that miR-433 and miR-127 might act as tumor suppressors in GC, and it may provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic options for human GC clinical operation in the near future.

23884313	Title	MicroRNA-203 regulates melanosome transport and tyrosinase expression in melanoma cells by targeting kinesin superfamily protein 5b.
23884313	Abstract	MicroRNA (miR)-203 is known to be downregulated and to act as an anti-oncomir in melanoma cells. At present, we found that exogenous miR-203 increased pigmentation and protein expression levels of the melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (Melan-As/MART1s) and/or tyrosinase (TYR) in the human melanoma cells tested. Inversely, treatment with an inhibitor of miR-203 downregulated the expression level of TYR. The target gene of miR-203 involved in the mechanism was kinesin superfamily protein 5b (kif5b), which was revealed by gene silencing using short interfering RNA and luciferase activity assay. Furthermore, immunocytochemistry showed obvious accumulation of melanosomes around nuclei of human melanoma Mewo cells transfected with miR-203 or siR-kif5b. Importantly, treatment with the miR-203 inhibitor, but not miR-203, exhibited effects on human epidermal melanocytes isolated from lightly pigmented adult skin similar to those on melanoma cells. In addition, the data indicated that exogenous miR-203 also negatively regulated the cAMP response element-binding protein 1 (CREB1)/microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)/Rab27a pathway, which is one of the main pathways active in melanoma cells. In conclusion, our data indicated that anti-oncogenic miR-203 had a pivotal role in melanoma through reducing melanosome transport and promoting melanogenesis by targeting kif5b and through negative regulation of the CREB1/MITF/Rab27a pathway.

23887392	Title	Development associated profiling of chitinase and microRNA of Helicoverpa armigera identified chitinase repressive microRNA.
23887392	Abstract	Expression of chitinase is developmentally regulated in insects in consonance with their molting process. During the larval-larval metamorphosis in Helicoverpa armigera, chitinase gene expression varies from high to negligible. In the five-day metamorphic course of fifth-instar larvae, chitinase transcript is least abundant on third day and maximal on fifth day. MicroRNA library prepared from these highest and lowest chitinase-expressing larval stages resulted in isolation of several miRNAs. In silico analysis of sequenced miRNAs revealed three miRNAs having sequence similarity to 3'UTR of chitinase. Gene-targeted specific action of these miRNAs, was investigated by luciferase reporter having 3'UTR of chitinase. Only one of three miRNAs, miR-24, inhibited luciferase expression. Further, a day-wise in vivo quantification of miR-24 in fifth-instar larvae revealed a negative correlation with corresponding chitinase transcript abundance. The force-feeding of synthetic miR-24 induced significant morphological aberrations accompanied with arrest of molting. These miR-24 force-fed larvae revealed significantly reduced chitinase transcript abundance.

23888942	Title	Oxidative stress upregulates PDCD4 expression in patients with gastric cancer via miR-21.
23888942	Abstract	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a key role in carcinogenesis by aberrantly inducing signaling networks that initiatiate tumorigenesis and stimulate tumor progression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise a novel class of endogenous, small, noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate approximately 30% of the genes in a cell via degradation or translational inhibition of their target mRNAs. However, the effects of ROS on miRNAs expression and the role of miRNAs in ROS-mediated injury on carcinogenesis are uncertain. Using UV spectrophotometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we examined tissues from human gastric cancers and tissues adjascent to gastric cancer and normal gastric tissues and found that total anti-oxidation competence (T-AOC), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) concentrations were lower in gastric cancer patients compared to the control subjects, while the concentrations of DNA oxidative damage product 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was higher. To determine the potential role of miRNA in gastric carcinogenesis, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) analysis was performed. We found that human 8-oxoguanine DNA N-glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) mRNA and miR-21 expression were significantly upregulated in gastric cancer tissues than in the adjacent normal gastric tissues. Furthermore, the expression of programmed cell death 4 protein (PDCD4) in gastric cancer tissues was significantly lower than in adjacent normal gastric tissues. The expression of miR-21 and PDCD4 was highly correlated with the degree of differentiation, tumor staging, local lymphatic node metastasis and remote metastasis. Expression of miR-21 was negatively correlated with T-AOC, SOD and CAT, but positively correlated with 8-OHdG and hOGG1mRNA. In addition, the relative expression of PDCD4 was negatively correlated with miR-21. These results suggest that the defensive balance of oxidation and antioxidant system in patients with GC was impaired, resulting in enhanced oxidative tissue injury, which may directly contribute to gastric carcinogenesis. Thus we conclude that ROS promotes gastric carcinogenesis via upregulating miR-21 expression which in turn down-regulates the expression of PDCD4 in gastric cancer cells.

23889895	Title	Genome-wide identification, molecular cloning, expression profiling and posttranscriptional regulation analysis of the Argonaute gene family in Salvia miltiorrhiza, an emerging model medicinal plant.
23889895	Abstract	Argonaute (AGO) is the core component of RNA-induced silencing complex. The AGO gene family has been analyzed in various plant species; however, there is no report about AGOs in the well-known Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) plant, Salvia miltiorrhiza. Through a genome-wide analysis, we identified ten SmAGO genes in S. miltiorrhiza. Full-length cDNAs of all SmAGOs were subsequently cloned and sequenced. These SmAGOs were characterized using a comprehensive approach. Sequence features, gene structures and conserved domains were analyzed by the comparison of SmAGOs and AtAGOs. Phylogenetic relationships among AGO proteins from S. miltiorrhiza, Arabidopsis and rice were revealed. The expression levels of SmAGO genes in various tissues of S. miltiorrhiza were investigated. The results implied that some SmAGOs, such as SmAGO1, SmAGO2, SmAGO3, SmAGO7 and SmAGO10, probably played similar roles as their counterparts in Arabidopsis; whereas the others could be more species-specialized. It suggests the conservation and diversity of AGOs in plants. Additionally, we identified a total of 24 hairpin structures, representing six miRNA gene families, to be miRNA precursors. Using the modified 5'-RACE method, we confirmed that SmAGO1 and SmAGO2 were targeted by S. miltiorrhiza miR168a/b and miR403, respectively. It suggests the conservation of AGO1-miR168 and AGO2-miR403 regulatory modules in S. miltiorrhiza and Arabidopsis. This is the first attempt to explore SmAGOs and miRNAs in S. miltiorrhiza. The results provide useful information for further elucidation of gene silencing pathways in S. miltiorrhiza.

23893241	Title	miR-508-5p regulates multidrug resistance of gastric cancer by targeting ABCB1 and ZNRD1.
23893241	Abstract	Multidrug resistance (MDR) is usually correlated with the poor prognosis of gastric cancer. In this study, we revealed a total of 11 microRNAs (miRNA) that regulated MDR of gastric cancer via high-throughput functional screening, and miR-508-5p reversed MDR most efficiently among these candidate miRNAs. The overexpression of miR-508-5p was sufficient to reverse cancer cell resistance to multiple chemotherapeutics in vitro and sensitize tumours to chemotherapy in vivo. Further studies showed that miR-508-5p could directly target the 3'-untranslated regions of ABCB1 and Zinc ribbon domain-containing 1 (ZNRD1), and suppress their expression at the mRNA and protein levels. Meanwhile, the suppression of ZNRD1 led to a decrease in ABCB1. These findings suggest that a miR-508-5p/ZNRD1/ABCB1 regulatory loop has a critical role in MDR in gastric cancer. In addition, miR-508-5p could be used as a prognostic factor for overall survival in gastric cancer. These data reveal an important role for miR-508-5p in the regulation of MDR in gastric cancer, and suggest the potential application of miR-508-5p in drug resistance prediction and treatment.

23894305	Title	Low expression of miR-196b enhances the expression of BCR-ABL1 and HOXA9 oncogenes in chronic myeloid leukemogenesis.
23894305	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can function as tumor suppressors or oncogene promoters during tumor development. In this study, low levels of expression of miR-196b were detected in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. Bisulfite genomic sequencing PCR and methylation-specific PCR were used to examine the methylation status of the CpG islands in the miR-196b promoter in K562 cells, patients with leukemia and healthy individuals. The CpG islands showed more methylation in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia compared with healthy individuals (P<0.05), which indicated that low expression of miR-196b may be associated with an increase in the methylation of CpG islands. The dual-luciferase reporter assay system demonstrated that BCR-ABL1 and HOXA9 are the target genes of miR-196b, which was consistent with predictions from bioinformatics software analyses. Further examination of cell function indicated that miR-196b acts to reduce BCR-ABL1 and HOXA9 protein levels, decrease cell proliferation rate and retard the cell cycle. A low level of expression of miR-196b can cause up-regulation of BCR-ABL1 and HOXA9 expression, which leads to the development of chronic myeloid leukemia. MiR-196b may represent an effective target for chronic myeloid leukemia therapy.

23894385	Title	miR-27b represses migration of mouse MSCs to burned margins and prolongs wound repair through silencing SDF-1a.
23894385	Abstract	Interactions between stromal cell-derived factor-1Alpha (SDF-1Alpha) and its cognate receptor CXCR4 are crucial for the recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from bone marrow (BM) reservoirs to damaged tissues for repair during alarm situations. MicroRNAs are differentially expressed in stem cell niches, suggesting a specialized role in stem cell regulation. Here, we gain insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in regulating SDF-1Alpha. MSCs from green fluorescent protein transgenic male mice were transfused to irradiated recipient female C57BL/6 mice, and skin burn model of bone marrow-chimeric mice were constructed. Six miRNAs with differential expression in burned murine skin tissue compared to normal skin tissue were identified using microarrays and bioinformatics. The expression of miR-27b and SDF-1Alpha was examined in burned murine skin tissue using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The Correlation of miR-27b and SDF-1Alpha expression was analyzed by Pearson analysis Correlation. miRNAs suppressed SDF-1Alpha protein expression by binding directly to its 3'UTR using western blot and luciferase reporter assay. The importance of miRNAs in MSCs chemotaxis was further estimated by decreasing SDF-1Alpha in vivo and in vitro. miR-23a, miR-27a and miR-27b expression was significantly lower in the burned skin than in the normal skin (p<0.05). We also found that several miRNAs suppressed SDF-1Alpha protein expression, while just miR-27a and miR-27b directly bound to the SDF-1Alpha 3'UTR. Moreover, the forced over-expression of miR-27a and miR-27b significantly reduced the directional migration of mMSCs in vitro. However, only miR-27b in burn wound margins significantly inhibited the mobilization of MSCs to the epidermis. miR-27b may be a unique signature of the stem cell niche in burned mouse skin and can suppress the directional migration of mMSCs by targeting SDF-1Alpha by binding directly to its 3'UTR.

23894411	Title	miR-19a: an effective regulator of SOCS3 and enhancer of JAK-STAT signalling.
23894411	Abstract	Suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS) proteins are classic inhibitors of the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) pathway. Many cytokines and pathogenic mediators induce expression of SOCS, which act in a negative feedback loop to inhibit further signal transduction. SOCS mRNA expression is regulated by DNA binding of STAT proteins, however, their post-transcriptional regulation is poorly understood. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that bind to complementary sequences on target mRNAs, often silencing gene expression. miR-19a has been shown to regulate SOCS1 expression during mutiple myeloma and be induced by the anti-viral cytokine interferon-(IFN)-Alpha, suggesting a role in the regulation of the JAK-STAT pathway. This study aimed to identify targets of miR-19a in the JAK-STAT pathway and elucidate the functional consequences. Bioinformatic analysis identified highly conserved 3'UTR miR-19a target sequences in several JAK-STAT associated genes, including SOCS1, SOCS3, SOCS5 and Cullin (Cul) 5. Functional studies revealed that miR-19a significantly decreased SOCS3 mRNA and protein, while a miR-19a antagomir specifically reversed its inhibitory effect. Furthermore, miR-19a-mediated reduction of SOCS3 enhanced IFN-Alpha and interleukin (IL)-6 signal transduction through STAT3. These results reveal a novel mechanism by which miR-19a may augment JAK-STAT signal transduction via control of SOCS3 expression and are fundamental to the understanding of inflammatory regulation.

23894561	Title	miR-29b and miR-29c are involved in Toll-like receptor control of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in human plasmacytoid dendritic cells.
23894561	Abstract	Glucocorticoids (GCs) are frequently used to treat many of the acute disease manifestations associated with inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. However, Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway-activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are resistant to GC-induced apoptosis, which leads to the inefficiency of GCs in the treatment of type I interferon-related autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Therefore, compounds promoting pDC apoptosis may be helpful for improving the efficacy of GCs. In this study, we performed screening to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in TLR-inhibited GC-induced pDC apoptosis and found an array of miRNAs that may regulate pDC apoptosis. Among those demonstrating altered expression, 6 miRNAs were inhibited in TLR-activated pDCs. Bioinformatics analysis and functional studies indicated that miR-29b and miR-29c were 2 key miRNAs involved in TLR-inhibited GC-induced pDC apoptosis. Furthermore, both of these miRNAs promoted pDC apoptosis by directly targeting Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in human primary pDCs. Our findings provide new targets that could improve the efficacy of GCs for the treatment of SLE.

23895517	Title	MicroRNA regulate immune pathways in T-cells in multiple sclerosis (MS).
23895517	Abstract	MicroRNA are small noncoding RNA molecules that are involved in the control of gene expression. To investigate the role of microRNA in multiple sclerosis (MS), we performed genome-wide expression analyses of mRNA and microRNA in T-cells from MS patients and controls. Heparin-anticoagulated peripheral blood was collected from MS-patients and healthy controls followed by isolation of T-cells. MicroRNA and RNA from T-cells was prepared and hybridized to Affymetrix miR 2.0 array and Affymetrix U133Plus 2.0 Human Genome array (Santa Clara, CA), respectively. Verifications were performed with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We identified 2,452 differentially expressed genes and 21 differentially expressed microRNA between MS patients and controls. By Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, 20 of 21 differentially expressed microRNA were shown to affect the expression of their target genes, many of which were involved in the immune system. Tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 14 (TNFSF14) was a microRNA target gene significantly decreased in MS. The differential expression of mir-494, mir-197 and the predicted microRNA target gene TNFSF14 was verified by real-time PCR and ELISA. These findings indicate that microRNA may be important regulatory molecules in T-cells in MS.

23904188	Title	A truncated-Flt1 isoform of breast cancer cells is upregulated by Notch and downregulated by retinoic acid.
23904188	Abstract	We have previously reported that the major isoform of Flt1/VEGFR-1 expressed in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells was a truncated intracellular isoform transcribed from intron 21 (i21 Flt1). This isoform upregulated the active form of Src and increased breast cancer cell invasiveness. Since expression of the transmembrane and soluble Flt1 isoforms of HUVEC is activated by Notch signaling, we wondered whether the expression of the intracellular isoform i21 Flt1 was also dependent on Notch activation. We report here that the expression of i21 Flt1 in HUVEC and MDA-MB-231 cells is downregulated by the Gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT. In addition, treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with siRNA specific for Notch-1 and Notch-3 downregulates the expression of i21 Flt1. In agreement with these findings, HUVEC and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, cultured on dishes coated with recombinant human Dll4 extracellular domain, express higher levels of i21 Flt1. In cancer cells, Flt1 is a target of the micro RNA family miR-200. In MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, the truncated intracellular isoform i21 Flt1 is also negatively regulated by miR-200c. Retinoic acid interferes i21 Flt1 expression by downregulating Notch-3 and upregulating miR-200 expression. Treatment of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells with both a Gamma-secretase inhibitor and retinoic acid suppresses the expression of i21 Flt1, providing a new mechanism to explain the effectiveness of this therapeutic approach.

23904244	Title	MicroRNA-214 protects cardiac myocytes against H2O2-induced injury.
23904244	Abstract	Reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced cardiac myocyte injury resulting from changes in the expression levels of multiple genes plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of numerous heart diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine the potential roles of microRNA-214 (miR-214) in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated gene regulation in cardiac myocytes. In this study, we used quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) to demonstrate that miR-214 was upregulated in cardiac myocytes after treatment with H2O2. We transfected cells with pre-miR-214 to upregulate miR-214 expression and transfected cells with a miR-214 inhibitor (anti-miR-214) to downregulate miR-214 expression. H2O2-induced cardiac cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. The level of apoptosis was increased by the miR-214 inhibitor and decreased by pre-miR-214. Therefore, we believe that miR-214 plays a positive role in H2O2-induced cardiac cell apoptosis. Phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is constitutively active and is considered to be the primary downregulator of the pro-oncogenic PI3K/Akt pathway. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression of the PTEN protein in cardiac myocytes decreased after H2O2 induction. Anti-miR-214 increased PTEN protein expression level, in contrast, pre-miR-214 decreased the PTEN protein expression level in cultured cardiac myocytes. These results indicate that PTEN is regulated by miR-214 and serves as an important target of miR-214 in cardiac myocytes. In conclusion, miR-214 is sensitive to H2O2 stimulation, and miR-214 protects cardiac myocytes against H2O2-induced injury via one of its targets, PTEN.

23904792	Title	MicroRNA-143 inhibits migration and invasion of human non-small-cell lung cancer and its relative mechanism.
23904792	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in many biological processes, including cancer development. Among those miRNAs, miR-143 shows tumor-suppressive activity in some human cancers. However, the function and mechanism of miR-143 in lung cancer cells remains unknown. Here we explored the role of miR-143 in lung cancer. According to qRT-PCR, we found that miR-143 was notably down-regulated in 19 NSCLC tissues and 5 cell lines. In vitro experiments showed us that miR-143 could significantly suppress the migration and invasion of NSCLC cell lines while it had no effects on the growth of NSCLC cell lines, and in vivo metastasis assay showed the same results. Finally, we found that the mechanism of miR-143 inhibiting the migration and invasion of NSCLC might be through targeting CD44v3. The up-regulated miR-143 in lung cancer could significantly inhibit cell migration and invasion, and this might work through targeting CD44v3, which was newly identified by us.

23905773	Title	MiR-214 promotes the alcohol-induced oxidative stress via down-regulation of glutathione reductase and cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase in liver cells.
23905773	Abstract	The involvement of oxidative stress in the pathophysiological process of alcohol-induced liver injury has been studied for decades. However, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting to oxidative stress genes in the pathogenesis of alcohol-induced liver injury has not yet been determined. The aim of this study was to identify the targeting of miR-214 to both glutathione reductase (GSR) and cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) genes and elucidate their impact on alcohol-induced oxidative stress in liver cells. The miR-214 expression vector and reporter vectors of GSR and POR 3'-UTR were constructed. Human hepatoma cell (Bel7402), human embryonic kidney 293 cell (HEK293), and rat normal hepatocyte (BRL) were transfected and stimulated with ethanol (EtOH). Wistar rats were fed with EtOH for 4 weeks. The GSR and POR protein levels were detected by Western blot, and their activities were measured using the spectrophotometric method. The miR-214 expression was detected by real-time PCR. The index of oxidative stress including the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and malondialdehyde (MDA) level was detected by commercial kits. miR-214 bound specifically to the GSR and POR 3'-UTR and repressed the expressions and activities of both GSR and POR. EtOH up-regulated the miR-214 expression, down-regulated the GSR and POR protein levels and activities, and induced the oxidative stress in human and rat liver cells. EtOH-fed Wistar rats further confirmed that alcohol up-regulates the miR-214 expression in liver and repressed both GSR and POR in vivo. These findings demonstrated a new mechanism by which the alcohol repressed the GSR and POR expression via up-regulation of miR-214 and in turn induced oxidative stress in liver cells.

23907579	Title	Anti-cancer activity of DHA on gastric cancer--an in vitro and in vivo study.
23907579	Abstract	Treatment of gastric cancer remains a major challenge, and new anticancer drugs are urgently required. This study investigated whether dihydroartemisinin (DHA), a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin, could inhibit the growth of gastric cancer both in vitro and in vivo. A series of in vitro experiments including MTT, colony-forming, wound healing, invasion, cell cycle, cellular senescence, and apoptosis assays were performed to examine the antiproliferative and antimetastatic effects of DHA on three gastric cancer cell lines, SGC-7901, BGC823, and MGC803. The result showed that the proliferation rate and colony-forming abilities of gastric cancer cells were significantly suppressed by DHA together with significant suppression of the expressions of proliferation markers (PCNA, cyclin E, and cyclin D1), and upregulation of p21 and p27. Moreover, DHA induced cellular senescence, G1 phase cell cycle arrest and hindered the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells corresponding with downregulation of MMP-9 and MMP-2. Furthermore, DHA significantly induced apoptosis through suppressing Bcl-2 as well as activating caspase-9 and PARP. Treatment of gastric cancer cells with DHA increased miR-15b and miR-16 expression, caused a downregulation of Bcl-2, resulting in apoptosis of gastric cancer cells. In vivo, our data showed that DHA significantly inhibited the growth of SGC7901 cell-transplanted tumors. In summary, we have shown that DHA is able to inhibit the growth and metastasis of human gastric cancer. The modulation of miR-15b and miR-16 mediated the apoptosis effects of DHA in gastric cancer cells. Our work suggested that DHA has significant anticancer effects against gastric cancer both in vivo and in vitro, indicating that it is a promising therapy for human gastric cancer.

23913306	Title	Autophagy suppresses tumorigenesis of hepatitis B virus-associated hepatocellular carcinoma through degradation of microRNA-224.
23913306	Abstract	In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), dysregulated expression of microRNA-224 (miR-224) and impaired autophagy have been reported separately. However, the relationship between them has not been explored. In this study we determined that autophagy is down-regulated and inversely correlated with miR-224 expression in hepatitis B virus (HBV)-associated HCC patient specimens. These results were confirmed in liver tumors of HBV X gene transgenic mice. Furthermore, miR-224 was preferentially recruited and degraded during autophagic progression demonstrated by real-time polymerase chain reaction and miRNA in situ hybridization electron microscopy after extraction of autophagosomes. Our in vitro study demonstrated that miR-224 played an oncogenic role in hepatoma cell migration and tumor formation through silencing its target gene Smad4. In HCC patients, the expression of low-Atg5, high-miR-224, and low-Smad4 showed significant correlation with HBV infection and a poor overall survival rate. Autophagy-mediated miR-224 degradation and liver tumor suppression were further confirmed by the autophagy inducer amiodarone and miR-224 antagonist using an orthotopic SD rat model. A noncanonical pathway links autophagy, miR-224, Smad4, and HBV-associated HCC. These findings open a new avenue for the treatment of HCC.

23913442	Title	MicroRNA-494 within an oncogenic microRNA megacluster regulates G1/S transition in liver tumorigenesis through suppression of mutated in colorectal cancer.
23913442	Abstract	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with poor survival for patients and few effective treatment options, raising the need for novel therapeutic strategies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in tumor development and show deregulated patterns of expression in HCC. Because of the liver's unique affinity for small nucleic acids, miRNA-based therapy has been proposed in the treatment of liver disease. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify and characterize aberrantly expressed miRNAs in HCC. In our study, we profiled miRNA expression changes in de novo liver tumors driven by MYC and/or RAS, two canonical oncogenes activated in a majority of human HCCs. We identified an up-regulated miRNA megacluster comprised of 53 miRNAs on mouse chromosome 12qF1 (human homolog 14q32). This miRNA megacluster is up-regulated in all three transgenic liver models and in a subset of human HCCs. An unbiased functional analysis of all miRNAs within this cluster was performed. We found that miR-494 is overexpressed in human HCC and aids in transformation by regulating the G1 /S cell cycle transition through targeting of the Mutated in Colorectal Cancer tumor suppressor. miR-494 inhibition in human HCC cell lines decreases cellular transformation, and anti-miR-494 treatment of primary MYC-driven liver tumor formation significantly diminishes tumor size. Our findings identify a new therapeutic target (miR-494) for the treatment of HCC. 

23924943	Title	Involvement of miR-20a in promoting gastric cancer progression by targeting early growth response 2 (EGR2).
23924943	Abstract	Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common cancers, with high incidences in East Asia. microRNAs (miRNAs) play essential roles in the carcinogenesis of GC. miR-20a was elevated in GC, while the potential function of miR-20a was poorly understood. miR-20a expression was examined in GC tissues and cell lines. The effects of miR-20a on the growth, migration, invasion, and chemoresistance of GC cells were examined. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blot were used to screen the target of miR-20a. miR-20a was increased in GC tissues and cell lines. miR-20a promoted the growth, migration and invasion of GC cells, enhanced the chemoresistance of GC cells to cisplatin and docetaxel. Luciferase activity and Western blot confirmed that miR-20a negatively regulated EGR2 expression. Overexpression of EGR2 significantly attenuated the oncogenic effect of miR-20a. miR-20a was involved in the carcinogenesis of GC through modulation of the EGR2 signaling pathway.

23928694	Title	Early methyl donor deficiency may induce persistent brain defects by reducing Stat3 signaling targeted by miR-124.
23928694	Abstract	The methyl donors folate (vitamin B9) and vitamin B12 are centrepieces of the one-carbon metabolism that has a key role in transmethylation reactions, and thus in epigenetic and epigenomic regulations. Low dietary intakes of folate and vitamin B12 are frequent, especially in pregnant women and in the elderly, and deficiency constitutes a risk factor for various diseases, including neurological and developmental disorders. In this respect, both vitamins are essential for normal brain development, and have a role in neuroplasticity and in the maintenance of neuronal integrity. The consequences of a methyl donor deficiency (MDD) were studied both in vivo in rats exposed in utero, and in vitro in hippocampal progenitors (H19-7 cell line). Deficiency was associated with growth retardation at embryonic day 20 (E20) and postnatally with long-term brain defects in selective areas. mRNA and protein levels of the transcription factor Stat3 were found to be decreased in the brains of deprived fetuses and in differentiating progenitors (62 and 48% for total Stat3 protein, respectively), along with a strong reduction in its phosphorylation at both Tyr⁷⁰⁵ and Ser⁷²⁷ residues. Vitamin shortage also affected upstream kinases of Stat3 signaling pathway (phospho-Erk1/2, phospho-Src, phospho-JNK, and phospho-p38) as well as downstream target gene products (Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL), thus promoting apoptosis. Conversely, the expression of the Stat3 regulator miR-124 was upregulated in deficiency conditions (≥65%), and its silencing by using siRNA partly restored Stat3 signaling in hippocampal neurons by increasing specifically the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Src kinases. Furthermore, miR-124 siRNA improved the phenotype of deprived cells, with enhanced neurite outgrowth. Taken together, our data suggest that downregulation of Stat3 signaling by miR-124 would be a key factor in the deleterious effects of MDD on brain development.

23928699	Title	OCT4 promotes tumorigenesis and inhibits apoptosis of cervical cancer cells by miR-125b/BAK1 pathway.
23928699	Abstract	Octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) is a key regulatory gene that maintains the pluripotency and self-renewal properties of embryonic stem cells. Although there is emerging evidence that it can function as oncogene in several cancers, the role in mediating cervical cancer remains unexplored. Here we found that OCT4 protein expression showed a pattern of gradual increase from normal cervix to cervical carcinoma in situ and then to invasive cervical cancer. Overexpression of OCT4 in two types of cervical cancer cells promotes the carcinogenesis, and inhibits cancer cell apoptosis. OCT4 induces upregulation of miR-125b through directly binding to the promoter of miR-125b-1 confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. MiRNA-125b overexpression suppressed apoptosis and expression of BAK1 protein. In contrast, miR-125b sponge impaired the anti-apoptotic effect of OCT4, along with the upregulated expression of BAK1. Significantly, Luciferase assay showed that the activity of the wild-type BAK1 3'-untranslated region reporter was suppressed and this suppression was diminished when the miR-125b response element was mutated or deleted. In addition, we observed negative correlation between levels of BAK1 and OCT4, and positive between OCT4 and miR-125b in primary cervical cancers. These findings suggest an undescribed regulatory pathway in cervical cancer, by which OCT4 directly induces expression of miR-125b, which inhibits its direct target BAK1, leading to suppression of cervical cancer cell apoptosis.

23928793	Title	The brain microenvironment negatively regulates miRNA-768-3p to promote K-ras expression and lung cancer metastasis.
23928793	Abstract	The brain microenvironment promotes metastasis through mechanisms that remain elusive. Co-culture of lung cancer cells with astrocytes - the most abundant cell type within the metastatic brain niche - lead to downregulation of miRNA-768-3p which drives K-ras expression and key signaling pathways, enhances cell viability and promotes chemotherapeutic resistance. Vector-based forced expression of miRNA-768-3p complementary sequence or a chemically-engineered miRNA-768-3p inhibitor recapitulated the astrocyte effect to increase tumor cell viability. The miRNA-768-3p inhibitor targeted the K-ras 3'-UTR as demonstrated by increased luminescence from a luciferase reporter and strikingly increased the K-ras protein and the downstream effectors ERK1/2 and B-Raf. miRNA-768-3p was reduced in patient brain metastases compared to normal brain tissue and was lower in patient tissue from brain metastases compared to same-patient primary tumour tissue. The brain microenvironment negatively regulates miRNA-768-3p to enhance K-ras and promote metastasis. We propose that therapeutic replacement of the metastasis suppressor miRNA-768-3p holds clinical promise.

23932921	Title	DDX6 post-transcriptionally down-regulates miR-143/145 expression through host gene NCR143/145 in cancer cells.
23932921	Abstract	In various human malignancies, widespread dysregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression is reported to occur and affects various cell growth programs. Recent studies suggest that the expression levels of miRNAs that act as tumor suppressors are frequently reduced in cancers because of chromosome deletions, epigenetical changes, aberrant transcription, and disturbances in miRNA processing. MiR-143 and -145 are well-recognized miRNAs that are highly expressed in several tissues, but down-regulated in most types of cancers. However, the mechanism of this down-regulation has not been investigated in detail. Here, we show that DEAD-box RNA helicase 6, DDX6 (p54/RCK), post-transcriptionally down-regulated miR-143/145 expression by prompting the degradation of its host gene product, NCR143/145 RNA. In human gastric cancer cell line MKN45, DDX6 protein was abundantly expressed and accumulated in processing bodies (P-bodies). DDX6 preferentially increased the instability of non-coding RNA, NCR143/145, which encompasses the miR-143/145 cluster, and down-regulated the expression of mature miR-143/145. In human monocytic cell line THP-1, lipopolysaccharide treatment promoted the assembly of P-bodies and down-regulated the expression of NCR143/145 and its miR-143/145 rapidly. In these cells, cycloheximide treatment led to a loss of P-bodies and to an increase in NCR143/145 RNA stability, thus resulting in up-regulation of miR-143/145 expression. These data demonstrate that DDX6 contributed to the control of NCR143/145 RNA stability in P-bodies and post-transcriptionally regulated miR-143/145 expression in cancer cells.

23932924	Title	MicroRNA-106a induces multidrug resistance in gastric cancer by targeting RUNX3.
23932924	Abstract	Multidrug resistance (MDR) is the main barrier to the success of chemotherapy for gastric cancer (GC). miR-106a, which is highly expressed in GC, influences a variety of aspects of GC. However, the function of miR-106a in MDR of GC still remains unclear. In the present study, we found that miR-106a is elevated in MDR cell lines. miR-106a promotes chemo-resistance of GC cells, accelerates ADR efflux, and suppresses drug-induced apoptosis. Finally, we show that runt-related trans factor 3 (RUNX3) is the functional target of miR-106a. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that miR-106a may promote MDR in GC cells by targeting RUNX3.

23934065	Title	Transcription factor/microRNA axis blocks melanoma invasion program by miR-211 targeting NUAK1.
23934065	Abstract	Melanoma is one of the deadliest human cancers, responsible for approximately 80% of skin cancer mortalities. The aggressiveness of melanoma is due to its capacity to proliferate and rapidly invade surrounding tissues, leading to metastases. A recent model suggests melanoma progresses by reversibly switching between proliferation and invasion transcriptional signatures. Recent studies show that cancer cells are more sensitive to microRNA (miRNA) perturbation than are non-cancer cells; however, the roles of miRNAs in melanoma plasticity remain unexplored. Here, we use the gene expression profiles of melanoma and normal melanocytes to characterize the transcription factor-miRNA relationship that modulates the proliferative and invasive programs of melanoma. We identified two sets of miRNAs that likely regulate these programs. Interestingly, one of the miRNAs involved in melanoma invasion is miR-211, a known target of the master regulator microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). We demonstrate that miR-211 contributes to melanoma adhesion by directly targeting a gene, NUAK1. Inhibition of miR-211 increases NUAK1 expression and decreases melanoma adhesion, whereas upregulation of miR-211 restores adhesion through NUAK1 repression. This study defines the MITF/miR-211 axis that inhibits the invasive program by blocking adhesion. Furthermore, we have identified NUAK1 as a potential target for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

23934188	Title	miR-137 regulates the constitutive androstane receptor and modulates doxorubicin sensitivity in parental and doxorubicin-resistant neuroblastoma cells.
23934188	Abstract	Chemotherapy is the most common treatment for cancer. However, multidrug resistance (MDR) remains a major obstacle to effective chemotherapy, limiting the efficacy of both conventional chemotherapeutic and novel biologic agents. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), a xenosensor, is a key regulator of MDR. It functions in xenobiotic detoxification by regulating the expression of phase I drug-metabolizing enzymes and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, whose overexpression in cancers and whose role in drug resistance make them potential therapeutic targets for reducing MDR. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous negative regulators of gene expression and have been implicated in most cellular processes, including drug resistance. Here, we report the inversely related expression of miR-137 and CAR in parental and doxorubicin-resistant neuroblastoma cells, wherein miR-137 is downregulated in resistant cells. miR-137 overexpression resulted in downregulation of CAR protein and mRNA (via mRNA degradation); it sensitized doxorubicin-resistant cells to doxorubicin (as shown by reduced proliferation, increased apoptosis and increased G2-phase cell cycle arrest) and reduced the in vivo growth rate of neuroblastoma xenografts. We observed similar results in cellular models of hepatocellular and colon cancers, indicating that the doxorubicin-sensitizing effect of miR-137 is not tumor type-specific. Finally, we show for the first time a negative feedback loop whereby miR-137 downregulates CAR expression and CAR downregulates miR-137 expression. Hypermethylation of the miR-137 promoter and negative regulation of miR-137 by CAR contribute in part to reduced miR-137 expression and increased CAR and MDR1 expression in doxorubicin-resistant neuroblastoma cells. These findings demonstrate that miR-137 is a crucial regulator of cancer response to doxorubicin treatment, and they identify miR-137 as a highly promising target to reduce CAR-driven doxorubicin resistance.

23936026	Title	microRNA-124 inhibits migration and invasion by down-regulating ROCK1 in glioma.
23936026	Abstract	The extraordinary invasive capability is a major cause of treatment failure and tumor recurrence in glioma, however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing glioma invasion remain poorly understood. Evidence in other cell systems has implicated the regulatory role of microRNA in cell motility and invasion, which promotes us to investigate the biological functions of miR-124 in glioma in this regard. We have found that miR-124 is dramatically downregulated in clinical specimen of glioma and is negatively correlated with the tumor pathological grading in the current study. The cells transfected by miR-124 expression vector have demonstrated retarded cell mobility. Using a bioinformatics analysis approach, rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase 1 (ROCK1), a well-known cell mobility-related gene, has been identified as the target of miR-124. A dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm that miR-124 targeted directly the 3'UTR of ROCK1 gene and repressed the ROCK1 expression in U87MG human glioma cell line. Furthermore, experiments have shown that the decreased cell mobility was due to the actin cytoskeleton rearrangements and the reduced cell surface ruffle in U87MG glioma cells. These results are similar to the cellular responses of U87MG glioma cells to the treatment of Y-27632, an inhibitor of ROCK protein. Moreover, a constitutively active ROCK1 in miR-124 over-expressed glioma cells reversed the effects of miR-124. Our results revealed a novel mechanism that miR-124 inhibits glioma cells migration and invasion via ROCK1 downregulation. These results suggest that miR-124 may function as anti-migration and anti-invasion influence in glioma and provides a potential approach for developing miR-124-based therapeutic strategies for malignant glioma therapy.

23936094	Title	Decrease of miR-202-3p expression, a novel tumor suppressor, in gastric cancer.
23936094	Abstract	Emerging studies have indicated that microRNAs are involved in the development and progression of cancer. Here we found that miR-202-3p was frequently down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues. Overexpression of miR-202-3p in gastric cancer cells MKN-28 and BGC-823, markedly suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Gli1 expression was frequently positive in gastric cancer tissues and inversely correlated with miR-133b expression. We demonstrate that the transcriptional factor Gli1 was a target of miR-202-3p and plays an essential role as a mediator of the biological effects of miR-202-3p in gastric cancer. MiR-202-3p also inhibited the expression of Gamma-catenin and BCL-2. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-202-3p may function as a novel tumor suppressor in gastric cancer and its anti-tumor activity may attribute the direct targeting and inhibition of Gli1.

23936298	Title	Upregulated microRNA-92b regulates the differentiation and proliferation of EpCAM-positive fetal liver cells by targeting C/EBPß.
23936298	Abstract	microRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression. Although recent evidences have been indicated that their aberrant expression may play an important role in cancer stem cells, the mechanism of their deregulation in neoplastic transformation of liver cancer stem cells (LCSCs) has not been explored. In our study, the HCC model was established in F344 rats by DEN induction. The EpCAM(+) cells were sorted out from unfractionated fetal liver cells and liver cancer cells using the FACS analysis and miRNA expression profiles of two groups were screened through microarray platform. Gain-of-function studies were performed in vitro and in vivo to determine the role of miR-92b on proliferation and differentiation of the hepatic progenitors. In addition, luciferase reporter system and gene function analysis were used to predict miR-92b target. we found that miR-92b was highly downregulated in EpCAM(+) fetal liver cells in expression profiling studies. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated reverse correlation between miR-92b expression and differentiation degree in human HCC samples. Overexpression of miR-92b in EpCAM(+) fetal liver cells significantly increased proliferation and inhibited differentiation as well as in vitro and in vivo studies. Moreover, we verified that C/EBPß is a direct target of miR-92b and contributes to its effects on proliferation and differentiation. We conclude that aberrant expression of miR-92b can result in proliferation increase and differentiation arrest of hepatic progenitors by targeting C/EBPß.

23936390	Title	miRNA-29c suppresses lung cancer cell adhesion to extracellular matrix and metastasis by targeting integrin Beta1 and matrix metalloproteinase2 (MMP2).
23936390	Abstract	Our pilot study using miRNA arrays found that miRNA-29c (miR-29c) is differentially expressed in the paired low-metastatic lung cancer cell line 95C compared to the high-metastatic lung cancer cell line 95D. Bioinformatics analysis shows that integrin Beta1 and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) could be important target genes of miR-29c. Therefore, we hypothesized that miR-29c suppresses lung cancer cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) and metastasis by targeting integrin Beta1 and MMP2. The gain-of-function studies that raised miR-29c expression in 95D cells by using its mimics showed reductions in cell proliferation, adhesion to ECM, invasion and migration. In contrasts, loss-of-function studies that reduced miR-29c by using its inhibitor in 95C cells promoted proliferation, adhesion to ECM, invasion and migration. Furthermore, the dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that miR-29c inhibited the expression of the luciferase gene containing the 3'-UTRs of integrin Beta1 and MMP2 mRNA. Western blotting indicated that miR-29c downregulated the expression of integrin Beta1 and MMP2 at the protein level. Gelatin zymography analysis further confirmed that miR-29c decreased MMP2 enzyme activity. Nude mice with xenograft models of lung cancer cells confirmed that miR-29c inhibited lung cancer metastasis in vivo, including bone and liver metastasis. Taken together, our results demonstrate that miR-29c serves as a tumor metastasis suppressor, which suppresses lung cancer cell adhesion to ECM and metastasis by directly inhibiting integrin Beta1 and MMP2 expression and by further reducing MMP2 enzyme activity. The results show that miR-29c may be a novel therapeutic candidate target to slow lung cancer metastasis.

23936419	Title	Genistein inhibits prostate cancer cell growth by targeting miR-34a and oncogenic HOTAIR.
23936419	Abstract	Genistein is a soy isoflavone that has antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo. It has been shown that genistein inhibits many type of cancers including prostate cancer (PCa) by regulating several cell signaling pathways and microRNAs (miRNAs). Recent studies suggest that the long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are also involved in many cellular processes. At present there are no reports about the relationship between gensitein, miRNAs and lncRNAs. In this study, we focused on miRNAs, lncRNA that are regulated by genistein and investigated their functional role in PCa. Microarray (SurePrint G3 Human GE 8*60K) was used for expression profiling of genistein treated and control PCa cells (PC3 and DU145). Functional assay (cell proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis and cell cycle assays) were performed with the PCa cell lines, PC3 and DU145. Both in vitro and in vivo (nude mouse) models were used for growth assays. Luciferase reporter assays were used for binding of miR-34a to HOTAIR. LncRNA profiling showed that HOTAIR was highly regulated by genistein and its expression was higher in castration-resistant PCa cell lines than in normal prostate cells. Knockdown (siRNA) of HOTAIR decreased PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion and induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. miR-34a was also up-regulated by genistein and may directly target HOTAIR in both PC3 and DU145 PCa cells. Our results indicated that genistein inhibited PCa cell growth through down-regulation of oncogenic HOTAIR that is also targeted by tumor suppressor miR-34a. These findings enhance understanding of how genistein regulates lncRNA HOTAIR and miR-34a in PCa.

23939832	Title	MiR-26b is down-regulated in carcinoma-associated fibroblasts from ER-positive breast cancers leading to enhanced cell migration and invasion.
23939832	Abstract	Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) influence the behaviour of cancer cells but the roles of microRNAs in this interaction are unknown. We report microRNAs that are differentially expressed between breast normal fibroblasts and CAFs of oestrogen receptor-positive cancers, and explore the influences of one of these, miR-26b, on breast cancer biology. We identified differentially expressed microRNAs by expression profiling of clinical samples and a tissue culture model: miR-26b was the most highly deregulated microRNA. Using qPCR, miR-26b was confirmed as down-regulated in fibroblasts from 15 of 18 further breast cancers. Next, we examined whether manipulation of miR-26b expression changed breast fibroblast behaviour. Reduced miR-26b expression caused fibroblast migration and invasion to increase by up to three-fold in scratch-closure and trans-well assays. Furthermore, in co-culture with MCF7 breast cancer epithelial cells, fibroblasts with reduced miR-26b expression enhanced both MCF7 migration in trans-well assays and MCF7 invasion from three-dimensional spheroids by up to five-fold. Mass spectrometry was used to identify expression changes associated with the reduction of miR-26b expression in fibroblasts. Pathway analyses of differentially expressed proteins revealed that glycolysis/TCA cycle and cytoskeletal regulation by Rho GTPases are downstream of miR-26b. In addition, three novel miR-26b targets were identified (TNKS1BP1, CPSF7, COL12A1) and the expression of each in cancer stroma was shown to be significantly associated with breast cancer recurrence. MiR-26b in breast CAFs is a potent regulator of cancer behaviour in oestrogen receptor-positive cancers, and we have identified key genes and molecular pathways that act downstream of miR-26b in CAFs.

23940556	Title	MiR-124 suppresses growth of human colorectal cancer by inhibiting STAT3.
23940556	Abstract	Emerging evidence indicate that microRNAs (miRNAs) may play important roles in cancer. Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been frequently identified in different human malignancies, including colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the mechanism by which deregulated miRNAs impact the development of CRC remains largely elusive. In this study, we show that miR-124 is significantly down-regulated in CRC compared to adjacent non-tumor colorectal tissues. MiR-124 suppresses the expression of STAT3 by directly binding to its 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). Overexpression of miR-124 led to increased apoptosis of CRC cells and reduced tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Knocking down STAT3 expression by specific siRNA suppressed the growth of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo, resembling that of miR-124 overexpression. Moreover, overexpression of STAT3 in miR-124-transfected CRC cells effectively rescued the inhibition of cell proliferation caused by miR-124. These data suggest that miR-124 serves as a tumor suppressor by targeting STAT3, and call for the use of miR-124 as a potential therapeutic tool for CRC, where STAT3 is often hyper-activated.

23941513	Title	The identification of novel targets of miR-16 and characterization of their biological functions in cancer cells.
23941513	Abstract	In eukaryotes, miR-16 is an important microRNA (miRNA) that is involved in numerous biological processes. However, it is not fully understood how miR-16 executes its physiological functions. In the present study, we aimed to identify novel miR-16 targets and study their biological functions. Candidate target genes of miR-16 were screened by microarray analysis of mRNA levels in several cancer cell lines with enhanced miR-16. Three bioinformatics algorithms, including TargetScan, PicTar, and miRanda, were used in combination to calculate the miR-16 targets. The expression levels of miR-16 and target mRNA were examined by relative quantification RT-PCR, and the expression levels of target protein were detected by Western blot. Luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed to confirm direct targeting. The effect of miR-16 and target gene on cell viability was evaluated using MTT assays. The effects of miR-16 and target gene on apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were evaluated by flow cytometry analysis. By overexpressing miR-16 in several cancer cell lines and measuring global mRNA levels using microarray analysis, we identified 27 genes that may be regulated by miR-16. After the bioinformatics filtering process, 18 genes were selected as candidate miR-16 targets. Furthermore, we experimentally validated three of these candidates, MAP7 (microtubule-associated protein 7), PRDM4 (PR domain containing 4) and CDS2 (CDP-diacylglycerol synthase 2), as direct targets of miR-16. Finally, we demonstrated that miR-16 targeting MAP7 played a critical role in regulating proliferation but not apoptosis and cell cycle progression in cancer cells. In summary, the present study identifies several novel miR-16 targets and illustrates a novel function of miR-16 targeting MAP7 in modulating proliferation in cancer cells.

23945289	Title	Crucial role for early growth response-1 in the transcriptional regulation of miR-20b in breast cancer.
23945289	Abstract	Transcriptional regulation of miRNAs that control the pathogenesis of breast cancer remains largely unknown. Here, we showed that ionizing radiation, a known breast carcinogen, triggered the differential expression of miR-20b in mammary tissues. We identified several GC-rich consensus binding motifs for the zinc finger transcription factor early growth response-1 (EGR1) in miR-20b promoter. miR-20b was upregulated by IR and its upregulation correlated with EGR1 expression in the breast cancer cell line HCC1806. Therefore, we used HCC1806 cells as a model system to explore the role of EGR1 in miR-20b transcription. siRNA knockdown of EGR1 attenuated miR-20b expression. Luciferase assays showed that whereas EGR1 stimulated luciferase activity driven by the wild-type miR-20b promoter, this induction was abolished in the mutant miR-20 promoter construct. We noted significant enrichment of EGR1 at miR-20b promoter in HCC1806 cells compared with normal human mammary epithelial cells. Suppression of miR-20b significantly inhibited HCC1806 cell proliferation and migration, and led to G0/G1 and S phase arrest. In vitro RNA-pull down assays indicated that miR-20b targets numerous tumor suppressors, including PTEN and BRCA1, which were downregulated in HCC1806. Conversely, suppression of miR-20b increased PTEN and BRCA1 levels. Moreover, immunohistochemical and FISH analyses showed that the miR-20b expression correlated significantly with EGR1 levels in breast cancer tissues. Our findings thus demonstrate for the first time that EGR1 is a key player in the transcriptional control of miR-20b, and miR-20b may in turn function as an oncogene by contributing to breast tumorigenesis via tumor suppressor targeting.

23951060	Title	MicroRNA-185 and 342 inhibit tumorigenicity and induce apoptosis through blockade of the SREBP metabolic pathway in prostate cancer cells.
23951060	Abstract	MicroRNA (miRNA or miR) inhibition of oncogenic related pathways has been shown to be a promising therapeutic approach for cancer. Aberrant lipid and cholesterol metabolism is involved in prostate cancer development and progression to end-stage disease. We recently demonstrated that a key transcription factor for lipogenesis, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), induced fatty acid and lipid accumulation and androgen receptor (AR) transcriptional activity, and also promoted prostate cancer cell growth and castration resistance. SREBP-1 was overexpressed in human prostate cancer and castration-resistant patient specimens. These experimental and clinical results indicate that SREBP-1 is a potential oncogenic transcription factor in prostate cancer. In this study, we identified two miRNAs, miR-185 and 342, that control lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis in prostate cancer cells by inhibiting SREBP-1 and 2 expression and down-regulating their targeted genes, including fatty acid synthase (FASN) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR). Both miR-185 and 342 inhibited tumorigenicity, cell growth, migration and invasion in prostate cancer cell culture and xenograft models coincident with their blockade of lipogenesis and cholesterogenesis. Intrinsic miR-185 and 342 expression was significantly decreased in prostate cancer cells compared to non-cancerous epithelial cells. Restoration of miR-185 and 342 led to caspase-dependent apoptotic death in prostate cancer cells. The newly identified miRNAs, miR-185 and 342, represent a novel targeting mechanism for prostate cancer therapy.

23975832	Title	Downregulation of tumor suppressor MBP-1 by microRNA-363 in gastric carcinogenesis.
23975832	Abstract	Gastric carcinoma is one of the most common malignancies and the second most lethal cancer worldwide. The mechanisms underlying aggressiveness of gastric cancer still remain obscure. c-Myc promoter binding protein 1 (MBP-1) is a negative regulator of c-myc expression and ubiquitously expressed in normal human tissues. It is produced by alternative translation initiation of Alpha-enolase gene. Both MBP-1 and Alpha-enolase are involved in the control of tumorigenesis including gastric cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in tumorigenesis and could have diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic potential. In this study, whether miRNAs modulate tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells through targeting MBP-1 was evaluated. We found that miR-363 targets 3'-untranslated region of human MBP-1/Alpha-enolase messenger RNA. The exogenous miR-363 promotes growth, viability, progression, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumorsphere formation of SC-M1 gastric cancer cells through downregulation of MBP-1, whereas the knockdown of endogenous miR-363 suppresses tumorigenesis and progression of SC-M1 cells via upregulation of MBP-1. The miR-363/MBP-1 axis is also involved in the control of carcinogenesis in KATO III and SNU-16 gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, miR-363 induces the xenografted tumor growth and lung metastasis of SC-M1 cells through MBP-1 in vivo. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-363 plays an important role in the increment of gastric carcinogenesis via targeting MBP-1.

23979021	Title	MicroRNA-124 mediates the cholinergic anti-inflammatory action through inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.
23979021	Abstract	The vagus nerve can control inflammatory response through a 'cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway', which is mediated by the Alpha7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (Alpha7nAChR) on macrophages. However, the intracellular mechanisms that link Alpha7nAChR activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production remain not well understood. In this study, we found that miR-124 is upregulated by cholinergic agonists in LPS-exposed cells and mice. Utilizing miR-124 mimic and siRNA knockdown, we demonstrated that miR-124 is a critical mediator for the cholinergic anti-inflammatory action. Furthermore, our data indicated that miR-124 modulates LPS-induced cytokine production by targeting signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) to decrease IL-6 production and TNF-Alpha converting enzyme (TACE) to reduce TNF-Alpha release. These results also indicate that miR-124 is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.

23981575	Title	MiR-215 modulates gastric cancer cell proliferation by targeting RB1.
23981575	Abstract	Growing evidence indicates that miRNAs play critical roles in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Here, we report that miR-215 is significantly up-regulated in gastric cancer tissues from either gastrectomy or gastroscopy. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that miR-215 may be a candidate biomarker for gastric cancer diagnosis. Inhibition of miR-215 significantly suppressed gastric cancer cell proliferation possibly via G1 arrest. Further analyses indicated that miR-215 was able to target retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene 1 (RB1) through its 3'-UTR in gastric cancer cells. These data suggest that frequently up-regulated miR-215 in gastric cancer may influence cell proliferation by targeting RB1.

23981581	Title	MicroRNA let-7c inhibits migration and invasion of human non-small cell lung cancer by targeting ITGB3 and MAP4K3.
23981581	Abstract	MicroRNAs play an important regulatory role in carcinogenesis and cancer metastasis. Different members of let-7 family have been reported to be decreased in human lung tumors. However, the effect of specific let-7 member on metastasis of NSCLC remains undefined. Our current study detected the expression of let-7 members in 94 cases of NSCLC and a significant association was noticed between low levels of let-7c expression and metastasis, venous invasion, advanced TNM stages and poor survival of NSCLC patients. Consistently, ectopic expression of let-7c in relatively highly metastatic cells remarkably suppressed their migration and invasion. Inhibition of let-7c in cells with relatively low metastatic potential promoted their motility and invasion. We then analyzed the potential targets of let-7c and found that ITGB3 and MAP4K3 were directly repressed by let-7c. Upon restoring the expression of ITGB3 and MAP4K3, the effects of let-7c on tumor metastasis were partially reversed, and more importantly, the expression levels of ITGB3 and MAP4K3 were inversely correlated with let-7c in 64 NSCLC tissues. Collectively, our results suggest that let-7c, by degrading ITGB3 and MAP4K3, prevents NSCLC metastasis.

23982143	Title	Regulation of UHRF1 by miR-146a/b modulates gastric cancer invasion and metastasis.
23982143	Abstract	Epigenetic changes play significant roles in the development of cancer. UHRF1, as an epigenetic regulator, has been shown to be overexpressed and to coordinate tumor suppressor gene silencing in several cancers. However, the role and underlying mechanism of UHRF1 in gastric cancer (GC) progression remain largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the expression and function of UHRF1 in GC metastasis and explored its upstream regulatory mechanisms at the microRNA level. UHRF1 was overexpressed in GC tissues, especially in metastatic ones, and a high level of UHRF1 expression predicted poor survival. The down-regulation of UHRF1 suppressed GC invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. We identified and verified miR-146a and miR-146b as direct upstream regulators of UHRF1. Furthermore, the restoration of miR-146a/b dramatically reduced the expression of UHRF1 through the direct targeting of its 3'-UTR, and this effect in turn reactivated the slit homologue 3 (Slit3), cadherin 4 (CDH4), and runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) genes via promoter demethylation. Finally, analyses of miR-146a/b and UHRF1 levels in human GC tissues revealed that miR-146a/b correlated inversely with UHRF1 expression. These findings describe a new mechanism for the regulation of UHRF1 and aberrant DNA hypermethylation in GC. The newly identified miR-146a/b/UHRF1 axis provides insight into the GC metastasis process, and targeting this novel axis represents a therapeutic approach to blocking GC metastasis.

23983607	Title	Elevated miR-34c-5p mediates dermal fibroblast senescence by ultraviolet irradiation.
23983607	Abstract	Previous studies showed that several miRNAs can regulate pathways involved in UVB-induced premature senescence and response to ultraviolet irradiation. It has also been reported that miR-34c-5p may be involved in senescence-related mechanisms. We propose that miR-34c-5p may play a crucial role in senescence of normal human primary dermal fibroblasts. Here, we explored the roles of miR-34c-5p in UVB-induced premature senescence on dermal fibroblasts. MiR-34c-5p expression was increased in dermal fibroblasts after repeated subcytotoxic UVB treatments. Underexpression of miR-34c-5p in dermal fibroblasts led to a marked delay of many senescent phenotypes induced by repeated UVB treatments. Furthermore, underexpression of miR-34c-5p in dermal fibroblasts can antagonize the alteration of G1-arrested fibroblasts. Moreover, E2F3, which can inactivate p53 pathway and play a role in cell cycle progression, is a down-stream target of miR-34c-5p. Forced down-expression of miR-34c-5p decreased the expression of UVB-SIPS induced P21 and P53 at both mRNA and protein levels. Our data demonstrated that down-regulation of miR-34c-5p can protect human primary dermal fibroblasts from UVB-induced premature senescence via regulations of some senescence-related molecules.

23985560	Title	microRNA-9 targets the long non-coding RNA MALAT1 for degradation in the nucleus.
23985560	Abstract	microRNAs regulate the expression of over 60% of protein coding genes by targeting their mRNAs to AGO2-containing complexes in the cytoplasm and promoting their translational inhibition and/or degradation. There is little evidence so far for microRNA-mediated regulation of other classes of non-coding RNAs. Here we report that microRNA-9 (miR-9) regulates the expression of the Metastasis Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript 1 (MALAT-1), one of the most abundant and conserved long non-coding RNAs. Intriguingly, we find that miR-9 targets AGO2-mediated regulation of MALAT1 in the nucleus. Our findings reveal a novel direct regulatory link between two important classes of non-coding RNAs, miRs and lncRNAs, and advance our understanding of microRNA functions.

23988154	Title	SIV replication is directly downregulated by four antiviral miRNAs.
23988154	Abstract	Host cell microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to regulate the expression of both cellular and viral RNAs, in particular impacting both Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). To investigate the role of miRNAs in regulating replication of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in macrophage lineage cells, we used primary macrophages to study targeting of SIV RNA by miRNAs. We examined whether specific host miRNAs directly target SIV RNA early in infection and might be induced via type I interferon pathways. miRNA target prediction programs identified miRNA binding sites within SIV RNA. Predicted binding sites for miRs-29a, -29b, -9 and -146a were identified in the SIV Nef/U3 and R regions, and all four miRNAs decreased virus production and viral RNA expression in primary macrophages. To determine whether levels of these miRNAs were affected by SIV infection, IFNBeta or TNFAlpha treatments, miRNA RT-qPCR assays measured miRNA levels after infection or treatment of macrophages. SIV RNA levels as well as virus production was downregulated by direct targeting of the SIV Nef/U3 and R regions by four miRNAs. miRs-29a, -29b, -9 and -146a were induced in primary macrophages after SIV infection. Each of these miRNAs was regulated by innate immune signaling through TNFAlpha and/or the type I IFN, IFNBeta. The effects on miRNAs caused by HIV/SIV infection are illustrated by changes in their cellular expression throughout the course of disease, and in different patient populations. Our data demonstrate that levels of primary transcripts and mature miRs-29a, -29b, -9 and -146a are modulated by SIV infection. We show that the SIV 3' UTR contains functional miRNA response elements (MREs) for all four miRNAs. Notably, these miRNAs regulate virus production and viral RNA levels in macrophages, the primary cells infected in the CNS that drive inflammation leading to HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders. This report may aid in identification miRNAs that target viral RNAs and HIV/SIV specifically, as well as in identification of miRNAs that may be targets of new therapies to treat HIV.

23990020	Title	Pro-apoptotic miRNA-128-2 modulates ABCA1, ABCG1 and RXRAlpha expression and cholesterol homeostasis.
23990020	Abstract	Aberrant regulation of cholesterol homeostasis is associated with obesity as well as multiple types of cancer. However, the mechanism behind these is largely missing. Here, we show that microRNA (miRNA)-128-2 is not only a pro-apoptotic microRNA but it also alters the expression of genes involved in cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Cholesterol efflux via ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABCA1 and ABCG1) is a mechanism for cells to eliminate excess cholesterol and prevent cellular cholesterol accumulation. The regulation of these pathways is complex with transcriptional regulation by sterol-regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) and liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor (RXR) transcription factors but poorly understood at the post-transcriptional levels. MiR-128-2 increases the expression of SREBP2 and decreases the expression of SREBP1 in HepG2, MCF7 and HEK293T cells independent of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) status. MiR-128-2 inhibits the expression of ABCA1, ABCG1 and RXRAlpha directly through a miR-128-2-binding site within their respective 3'untranslated regions. The administration of miR-128-2 leads to decline in the protein and mRNA levels of ABCA1, ABCG1 and RXRAlpha. Conversely, anti-miRNA treatment leads to increased ABCA1, ABCG1 and RXRAlpha expression. The inverse correlation between miR-128-2 and its targets viz. ABCA1 and ABCG1 was also established during high-fat diet in different mice tissues. Our data show that cholesterol efflux is attenuated by miR-128-2 overexpression and, conversely, stimulated by miR-128-2 silencing. Further, we also observed the induction of ER stress response by miR-128-2. In this study, we provide the first evidence of miR-128-2 to be a new regulator of cholesterol homeostasis. Our study shows dual role of miR-128-2, as a pro-apoptotic molecule as well as a regulator of cholesterol homeostasis.

23990326	Title	Both mature miR-17-5p and passenger strand miR-17-3p target TIMP3 and induce prostate tumor growth and invasion.
23990326	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNA) precursor (pre-miRNA) molecules can be processed to release a miRNA/miRNA* duplex. In the canonical model of miRNA biogenesis, one strand of the duplex is thought to be the biologically active miRNA, whereas the other strand is thought to be inactive and degraded as a carrier or passenger strand called miRNA* (miRNA star). However, recent studies have revealed that miRNA* strands frequently play roles in the regulatory networks of miRNA target molecules. Our recent study indicated that miR-17 transgenic mice could abundantly express both the mature miR-17-5p and the passenger strand miR-17-3p. Here, we showed that miR-17 enhanced prostate tumor growth and invasion by increasing tumor cell proliferation, colony formation, cell survival and invasion. miRNA target analysis showed that both miR-17-5p and miR-17-3p repressed TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 (TIMP3) expression. Silencing with small interfering RNA against TIMP3 promoted cell survival and invasion. Ectopic expression of TIMP3 decreased cell invasion and cell survival. Our results demonstrated that mature miRNA can function coordinately with its passenger strand, enhancing the repressive ability of a miRNA by binding the same target. Within an intricate regulatory network, this may be among the mechanisms by which miRNA can augment their regulatory capacity.

23990780	Title	Nuclear hormone receptor regulation of microRNAs controls innate immune responses in C. elegans.
23990780	Abstract	Nuclear hormone receptors respond to small molecules such as retinoids or steroids and regulate development. Signaling in the conserved p38/PMK-1 MAP kinase pathway regulates innate immunity. In this study, we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans nuclear receptor DAF-12 negatively regulates the defense against pathogens via the downstream let-7 family of microRNAs, which directly target SKN-1, a gene downstream of PMK-1. These findings identify nuclear hormone receptors as components of innate immunity that crosstalk with the p38/PMK-1 MAP kinase pathway.

23991091	Title	MiR-155 has a protective role in the development of non-alcoholic hepatosteatosis in mice.
23991091	Abstract	Hepatic steatosis is a global epidemic that is thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes. MicroRNAs (miRs) are regulators that can functionally integrate a range of metabolic and inflammatory pathways in liver. We aimed to investigate the functional role of miR-155 in hepatic steatosis. Male C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and miR-155(-/-) mice were fed either normal chow or high fat diet (HFD) for 6 months then lipid levels, metabolic and inflammatory parameters were assessed in livers and serum of the mice. Mice lacking endogenous miR-155 that were fed HFD for 6 months developed increased hepatic steatosis compared to WT controls. This was associated with increased liver weight and serum VLDL/LDL cholesterol and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels, as well as increased hepatic expression of genes involved in glucose regulation (Pck1, Cebpa), fatty acid uptake (Cd36) and lipid metabolism (Fasn, Fabp4, Lpl, Abcd2, Pla2g7). Using miRNA target prediction algorithms and the microarray transcriptomic profile of miR-155(-/-) livers, we identified and validated that Nr1h3 (LXRAlpha) as a direct miR-155 target gene that is potentially responsible for the liver phenotype of miR-155(-/-) mice. Together these data indicate that miR-155 plays a pivotal role regulating lipid metabolism in liver and that its deregulation may lead to hepatic steatosis in patients with diabetes.

23991130	Title	MicroRNA-650 was a prognostic factor in human lung adenocarcinoma and confers the docetaxel chemoresistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells via regulating Bcl-2/Bax expression.
23991130	Abstract	Increasing evidence shows that dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is involved in malignant transformation. We investigated the clinical significance of miR-650 and its involvement in chemoresistance to docetaxel. Our results showed that the relative expression level of miR-650 was significantly higher in LAD tissues than in corresponding nontumor tissues and high level of miR-650 expression was found to be significantly associated with high incidence of lymph node metastasis, advanced clinical stage and poor prognosis of LAD patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated that high miR-650 expression was an independent prognostic factor for survival. Also, we found that the level of miR-650 in LAD tissues was correlated with the response of patients to docetaxel-based chemotherapy. Silencing of miR-650 could increase the in vitro sensitivity of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells to docetaxel, while upregulation of miR-650 decreased the sensitivity of parental LAD cells to docetaxel both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, silencing of miR-650 could enhance the caspase-3-dependent apoptosis, which might be correlated with the decreased ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. Further researches suggested that inhibitor of growth 4 (ING4) was a direct target of miR-650. Downregulated or upregulated ING4 expression could partially rescue the effects of miR-650 inhibitor or mimics in docetaxel-resistant or parental LAD cells. Furthermore, we found that ING4 was upregulated in docetaxel-responding LAD tissues, and its expression was inversely correlated with miR-650. Thus, miR-650 is a novel prognostic marker in LAD and its expression is a potential indicator of chemosensitivity to docetaxel-based chemotherapy regimen.

23995857	Title	miR-200b and miR-200c as prognostic factors and mediators of gastric cancer cell progression.
23995857	Abstract	The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinicopathologic significance and potential role of miR-200b and miR-200c in the development and progression of gastric cancer. We examined miR-200b and miR-200c expression in 36 paired normal and stomach tumor specimens, as well as gastric cancer cell lines, by quantitative real-time PCR. In addition, miR-200b and miR-200c were detected by ISH using gastric cancer tissue microarrays, and the association between miR-200b and miR-200c levels and clinicopathologic factors and prognosis were analyzed. A luciferase assay was conducted for target evaluation. The functional effects of miR-200b and miR-200c on gastric cancer cells were validated by a cell proliferation assay and cell invasion and migration assays. miR-200b and miR-200c were downregulated in the gastric cancer specimens and cell lines tested. miR-200b and miR-200c levels were significantly correlated with the clinical stage, T stage, lymph node metastasis, and survival of patients. Ectopic expression of miR-200b and miR-200c impaired cell growth and invasion. In addition, when overexpressed, miR-200b and miR-200c commonly directly targeted DNMT3A, DNMT3B, and SP1 (a transactivator of the DNMT1 gene), which resulted in marked reduction of the expression of DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B at the protein level. This effect, in turn, led to a decrease in global DNA methylation and reexpression of p16, RASS1A1, and E-cadherin via promoter DNA hypomethylation. Our findings suggest that miR-200b and miR-200c, as valuable markers of gastric cancer prognosis, may be a promising approach to human gastric cancer treatment.

23999091	Title	Promoter RNA links transcriptional regulation of inflammatory pathway genes.
23999091	Abstract	Although many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been discovered, their function and their association with RNAi factors in the nucleus have remained obscure. Here, we identify RNA transcripts that overlap the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) promoter and contain two adjacent binding sites for an endogenous miRNA, miR-589. We find that miR-589 binds the promoter RNA and activates COX-2 transcription. In addition to miR-589, fully complementary duplex RNAs that target the COX-2 promoter transcript activate COX-2 transcription. Activation by small RNA requires RNAi factors argonaute-2 (AGO2) and GW182, but does not require AGO2-mediated cleavage of the promoter RNA. Instead, the promoter RNA functions as a scaffold. Binding of AGO2 protein/small RNA complexes to the promoter RNA triggers gene activation. Gene looping allows interactions between the promoters of COX-2 and phospholipase A2 (PLA2G4A), an adjacent pro-inflammatory pathway gene that produces arachidonic acid, the substrate for COX-2 protein. miR-589 and fully complementary small RNAs regulate both COX-2 and PLA2G4A gene expression, revealing an unexpected connection between key steps of the eicosanoid signaling pathway. The work demonstrates the potential for RNA to coordinate locus-dependent assembly of related genes to form functional operons through cis-looping.

24001611	Title	MiR-203 suppresses tumor growth and invasion and down-regulates MiR-21 expression through repressing Ran in esophageal cancer.
24001611	Abstract	The expression of miR-203 has been reported to be significantly down-regulated in esophageal cancer. We showed here that overexpression of miR-203 in esophageal cancer cells dramatically increased cell apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as tumor growth and down-regulated miR-21 expression. We subsequently identified that small GTPase Ran was a target gene of miR-203. Furthermore, Ran restoration partially counteracted the tumor suppressive effects of miR-203 and increased miR-21 expression. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-203 may act as novel tumor suppressor in esophageal cancer through down-regulating the expression of Ran and miR-21.

24002805	Title	MicroRNA-106b modulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition by targeting TWIST1 in invasive endometrial cancer cell lines.
24002805	Abstract	Type II endometrial carcinoma is an aggressive subtype of endometrial cancer (EC). TWIST1, a helix-loop-helix transcription regulator, is known to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promote tumor metastasis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) also serve as important regulators of EMT and metastasis by regulating EMT-related genes. In this study, we sought to explore the role of TWIST1 in inducing EMT in representative type II EC cell lines, and to determine the miRNAs involved in regulating TWIST1 gene expression. Functional analysis suggested that TWIST1 contributes to the EMT phenotypes of EC cells, as evidenced by the acquisition of fibroblast-like properties, enhanced invasiveness, and induction of an EN-switch (downregulation of epithelial marker E-cadherin and upregulation of mesenchymal marker N-cadherin). Conversely, silencing of TWIST1 by siRNA inhibited cell invasion and the mesenchymal phenotype, which was accompanied by a reversion of the EN-switch. We also observed a novel post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of TWIST1 expression mediated by miR-106b via its direct interaction with TWIST1 mRNAs at the 3'-untranslated region. Our data suggest that TWIST1 is a critical inducer of EMT in invasive EC cells and that miR-106b could suppress EC cell invasion by downregulating TWIST1 expression.

24004633	Title	miR-31 controls osteoclast formation and bone resorption by targeting RhoA.
24004633	Abstract	Increased activity of osteoclasts is responsible for bone loss and joint destruction in rheumatoid arthritis. For osteoclast development and bone resorption activity, cytoskeletal organization must be properly regulated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that suppress expression of their target genes. This study was conducted to identify crucial miRNAs to control osteoclasts. miRNA expression in the bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) with or without receptor activator of nuclear factor KappaB ligand (RANKL) stimulation was analyzed by miRNA array. To examine the role of specific miRNAs in osteoclast formation, bone resorption activity and actin ring formation, the BMM were retrovirally transduced with miRNA antagomirs. To confirm whether the suppressive effects on osteoclastogenesis by miR-31 inhibition were mediated by targeting RhoA, osteoclast formation was analyzed in the presence of the RhoA inhibitor, exoenzyme C3. miR-31 was identified as one of the highly upregulated miRNAs during osteoclast development under RANKL stimulation. Inhibition of miR-31 by specific antagomirs suppressed the RANKL-induced formation of osteoclasts and bone resorption. Phalloidin staining of osteoclasts revealed that actin ring formation at the cell periphery was severely impaired by miR-31 inhibition, and clusters of small ringed podosomes were observed instead. In these osteoclasts, expression of RhoA, one of the miR-31 target genes, was upregulated by miR-31 inhibition in spite of the impaired osteoclastogenesis. Treatment with the RhoA inhibitor, exoenzyme C3, rescued the osteoclastogenesis impaired by miR-31 inhibition. miR-31 controls cytoskeleton organization in osteoclasts for optimal bone resorption activity by regulating the expression of RhoA.

24012640	Title	Blockage of a miR-21/EGFR regulatory feedback loop augments anti-EGFR therapy in glioblastomas.
24012640	Abstract	Epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) expression is frequently amplified in human glioblastoma cells. Nimotuzumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against EGFR, has been used globally in clinics as an anti-cancer agent. It is largely unknown whether the blockade of miR-21, a microRNA that is upregulated in glioma cells, could amplify the effects of nimotuzumab. Herein, we have demonstrated that miR-21 directly targets von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor Alpha (PPARAlpha) and that miR-21 regulates EGFR/AKT signaling through VHL/Beta-catenin and the PPARAlpha/AP-1 axis. Further, the expression of miR-21 is regulated by EGFR via the activation of Beta-catenin and AP-1. These data indicate that a feedback loop exists between miR-21 and EGFR. We also show that the combination of nimotuzumab and an inhibitor of miR-21 is superior to single-agent therapy. These results clarify a novel association between miR-21 and EGFR in the regulation of cancer cell progression.

24013226	Title	MicroRNA-148a suppresses the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis of hepatoma cells by targeting Met/Snail signaling.
24013226	Abstract	Metastasis is responsible for the rapid recurrence and poor survival of malignancies. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has a critical role in metastasis. Increasing evidence indicates that EMT can be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). miR-148a is a liver-abundant miRNA. However, the role of miR-148a in the development of liver cancer remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that, compared with normal livers, miR-148a was significantly decreased in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, especially in those with the portal vein tumor thrombus. An in vitro transwell assay and an in vivo orthotopic liver xenograft model showed that the restoration of miR-148a expression significantly repressed the migration and pulmonary metastasis of hepatoma cells. Linear regression analysis revealed a positive correlation between the expression of miR-148a and the mRNA level of E-cadherin gene in human HCC tissues. Both gain- and loss-of-function studies disclosed that miR-148a promoted the expression of epithelial marker (E-cadherin) and reduced the levels of mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, fibronectin or vimentin) in hepatoma cells. These data suggest that miR-148a may suppress EMT and cancer metastasis. Further mechanistic investigations showed that miR-148a directly inhibited Met expression by binding to its 3'-UTR. Moreover, the reintroduction of miR-148a attenuated the downstream signaling of Met, like activated phosphorylation of AKT-Ser473 and inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3Beta-Ser9, and consequently reduced the nuclear accumulation of Snail, a transcription factor that promotes EMT. Taken together, miR-148a may negatively regulate Met/Snail signaling and therefore inhibit the EMT and metastasis of hepatoma cells. These findings highlight the significance of miR-148a downregulation in tumor progression and implicate miR-148a as an attractive candidate for cancer therapy.

24013584	Title	miR-106a-5p inhibits the proliferation and migration of astrocytoma cells and promotes apoptosis by targeting FASTK.
24013584	Abstract	Astrocytomas are common malignant intracranial tumors that comprise the majority of adult primary central nervous system tumors. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs (20-24 nucleotides) that post-transcriptionally modulate gene expression by negatively regulating the stability or translational efficiency of their target mRNAs. In our previous studies, we found that the downregulation of miR-106a-5p in astrocytomas is associated with poor prognosis. However, its specific gene target(s) and underlying functional mechanism(s) in astrocytomas remain unclear. In this study, we used mRNA microarray experiments to measure global mRNA expression in the presence of increased or decreased miR-106a-5p levels. We then performed bioinformatics analysis based on multiple target prediction algorithms to obtain candidate target genes that were further validated by computational predictions, western blot analysis, quantitative real-time PCR, and the luciferase reporter assay. Fas-activated serine/threonine kinase (FASTK) was identified as a direct target of miR-106a-5p. In human astrocytomas, miR-106a-5p is downregulated and negatively associated with clinical staging, whereas FASTK is upregulated and positively associated with advanced clinical stages, at both the protein and mRNA levels. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the reduced expression of miR-106a-5p or the increased expression of FASTK is significantly associated with poor survival outcome. These results further supported the finding that FASTK is a direct target gene of miR-106a-5p. Next, we explored the function of miR-106a-5p and FASTK during astrocytoma progression. Through gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies, we demonstrated that miR-106a-5p can significantly inhibit cell proliferation and migration and can promote cell apoptosis in vitro. The knockdown of FASTK induced similar effects on astrocytoma cells as those induced by the overexpression of miR-106a-5p. These observations suggest that miR-106a-5p functions as a tumor suppressor during the development of astrocytomas by targeting FASTK.

24014289	Title	Alteration of the microRNA network during the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
24014289	Abstract	An overview of miRNAs altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD) was established by profiling the hippocampus of a cohort of 41 late-onset AD (LOAD) patients and 23 controls, showing deregulation of 35 miRNAs. Profiling of miRNAs in the prefrontal cortex of a second independent cohort of 49 patients grouped by Braak stages revealed 41 deregulated miRNAs. We focused on miR-132-3p which is strongly altered in both brain areas. Downregulation of this miRNA occurs already at Braak stages III and IV, before loss of neuron-specific miRNAs. Next-generation sequencing confirmed a strong decrease of miR-132-3p and of three family-related miRNAs encoded by the same miRNA cluster on chromosome 17. Deregulation of miR-132-3p in AD brain appears to occur mainly in neurons displaying Tau hyper-phosphorylation. We provide evidence that miR-132-3p may contribute to disease progression through aberrant regulation of mRNA targets in the Tau network. The transcription factor (TF) FOXO1a appears to be a key target of miR-132-3p in this pathway.

24015269	Title	miR-26a suppresses tumor growth and metastasis by targeting FGF9 in gastric cancer.
24015269	Abstract	The role of miR-26a in cancer cells seemed controversial in previous studies. Until now, the role of miR-26a in gastric cancer remains undefined. In this study, we found that miR-26a was strongly downregulated in gastric cancer (GC) tissues and cell lines, and its expression levels were associated with lymph node metastasis and clinical stage, as well as overall survival and replase-free survival of GC. We also found that ectopic expression of miR-26a inhibited GC cell proliferation and GC metastasis in vitro and in vivo. We further identified a novel mechanism of miR-26a to suppress GC growth and metastasis. FGF9 was proved to be a direct target of miR-26a, using luciferase assay and western blot. FGF9 overexpression in miR-26a-expressing cells could rescue invasion and growth defects of miR-26a. In addition, miR-26a expression inversely correlated with FGF9 protein levels in GC. Taken together, our data suggest that miR-26a functions as a tumor suppressor in GC development and progression, and holds promise as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for GC.

24023010	Title	A novel negative regulator of adipogenesis: microRNA-363.
24023010	Abstract	The differentiation of adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) into adipocytes involves a highly orchestrated series of events that includes cell lineage commitment, mitotic clonal expansion, growth arrest, and terminal differentiation. However, the molecular mechanisms controlling adipogenesis are not yet completely understood. In this study, we investigated whether microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in adipocyte differentiation. Microarray analysis was performed to determine the miRNA expression profile during ADSC differentiation, and miR-363 was found to be one of the most significantly downregulated miRNAs. We show that the overexpression of miR-363 in ADSCs inhibited mitotic clonal expansion and terminal differentiation. Furthermore, ectopic introduction of miR-363 into ADSCs markedly reduced the levels of E2F3, a key transcription factor that regulates growth and proliferation during mitotic clonal expansion. Finally, using an EGFP/RFP reporter assay, we demonstrate that miR-363 can directly target the 3'UTR of E2F3. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-363 regulates the transition from mitotic clonal expansion to terminal differentiation during adipogenesis in ADSCs, at least in part, by targeting E2F3.

24023888	Title	miR-206 represses hypertrophy of myogenic cells but not muscle fibers via inhibition of HDAC4.
24023888	Abstract	microRNAs regulate the development of myogenic progenitors, and the formation of skeletal muscle fibers. However, the role miRNAs play in controlling the growth and adaptation of post-mitotic musculature is less clear. Here, we show that inhibition of the established pro-myogenic regulator miR-206 can promote hypertrophy and increased protein synthesis in post-mitotic cells of the myogenic lineage. We have previously demonstrated that histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) is a target of miR-206 in the regulation of myogenic differentiation. We confirmed that inhibition of miR-206 de-repressed HDAC4 accumulation in cultured myotubes. Importantly, inhibition of HDAC4 activity by valproic acid or sodium butyrate prevented hypertrophy of myogenic cells otherwise induced by inhibition of miR-206. To test the significance of miRNA-206 as a regulator of skeletal muscle mass in vivo, we designed recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (rAAV6 vectors) expressing miR-206, or a miR-206 "sponge," featuring repeats of a validated miR-206 target sequence. We observed that over-expression or inhibition of miR-206 in the muscles of mice decreased or increased endogenous HDAC4 levels respectively, but did not alter muscle mass or myofiber size. We subsequently manipulated miR-206 levels in muscles undergoing follistatin-induced hypertrophy or denervation-induced atrophy (models of muscle adaptation where endogenous miR-206 expression is altered). Vector-mediated manipulation of miR-206 activity in these models of cell growth and wasting did not alter gain or loss of muscle mass respectively. Our data demonstrate that although the miR-206/HDAC4 axis operates in skeletal muscle, the post-natal expression of miR-206 is not a key regulator of basal skeletal muscle mass or specific modes of muscle growth and wasting. These studies support a context-dependent role of miR-206 in regulating hypertrophy that may be dispensable for maintaining or modifying the adult skeletal muscle phenotype--an important consideration in relation to the development of therapeutics designed to manipulate microRNA activity in musculature.

24026406	Title	MicroRNA-92a functions as an oncogene in colorectal cancer by targeting PTEN.
24026406	Abstract	Our previous studies show that microRNA-92a (miR-92a) is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and is thought to be correlated with the development of the cancer. However, its biological role in CRC remains poorly understood. The aim of the study was to determine the role of miR-92a and to elucidate its regulatory mechanism in CRC. The expression levels of miR-92a and phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot. MTT, migration and invasion assays were used to examine the proliferation, migration and invasion of pre-miR-92a transfected SW480 cells, and a mouse model was used to investigate tumorigenesis. In addition, the regulation of PTEN by miR-92a was evaluated by qRT-PCR, western blot and luciferase reporter assays. The expression of miR-92a was significantly up-regulated in the tissues of CRC patients with lymph node metastasis. The ectopic expression of miR-92a enhanced CRC cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Similar results were found in xenograft assay performed in nude mice. Up-regulation of miR-92a induced EMT in CRC cells. There was an inverse correlation between the levels of miR-92a and PTEN in CRC tissues. The overexpression of miR-92a in CRC cells decreased PTEN expression at the translational level, and decreased PTEN-driven luciferase-reporter activity. Our results demonstrated that miR-92a induced EMT and regulated cell growth, migration and invasion in the SW480 cells, at least partially, via suppression of PTEN expression. MiR-92a may serve as a novel therapeutic target in colorectal cancer.

24036151	Title	MIR106B and MIR93 prevent removal of bacteria from epithelial cells by disrupting ATG16L1-mediated autophagy.
24036151	Abstract	Variants in genes that regulate autophagy have been associated with Crohn's disease (CD). Defects in autophagy-mediated removal of pathogenic microbes could contribute to the pathogenesis of CD. We investigated the role of the microRNAs (miRs) MIR106B and MIR93 in induction of autophagy and bacterial clearance in human cell lines and the correlation between MIR106B and autophagy-related gene 16L1 (ATG16L1) expression in tissues from patients with CD. We studied the ability of MIR106B and MIR93 to regulate ATG transcripts in human cancer cell lines (HCT116, SW480, HeLa, and U2OS) using luciferase report assays and bioinformatics analyses; MIR106B and MIR93 mimics and antagonists were transfected into cells to modify levels of miRs. Cells were infected with LF82, a CD-associated adherent-invasive strain of Escherichia coli, and monitored by confocal microscopy and for colony-forming units. Colon tissues from 41 healthy subjects (controls), 22 patients with active CD, 16 patients with inactive CD, and 7 patients with chronic inflammation were assessed for levels of MIR106B and ATG16L1 by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Silencing Dicer1, an essential processor of miRs, increased levels of ATG protein and formation of autophagosomes in cells, indicating that miRs regulate autophagy. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that MIR106B and MIR93 targeted ATG16L1 messenger RNA. MIR106B and MIR93 reduced levels of ATG16L1 and autophagy; these increased after expression of ectopic ATG16L1. In contrast, MIR106B and MIR93 antagonists increased formation of autophagosomes. Levels of MIR106B were increased in intestinal epithelia from patients with active CD, whereas levels of ATG16L1 were reduced compared with controls. Levels of c-Myc were also increased in intestinal epithelia of patients with active CD compared with controls. These alterations could impair removal of CD-associated bacteria by autophagy. In human cell lines, MIR106B and MIR93 reduce levels of ATG16L1 and autophagy and prevent autophagy-dependent eradication of intracellular bacteria. This process also appears to be altered in colon tissues from patients with active CD.

24036951	Title	Dampening of expression oscillations by synchronous regulation of a microRNA and its target.
24036951	Abstract	The complexity of multicellular organisms requires precise spatiotemporal regulation of gene expression during development. We find that in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans approximately 2,000 transcripts undergo expression oscillations synchronized with larval transitions while thousands of genes are expressed in temporal gradients, similar to known timing regulators. By counting transcripts in individual worms, we show that pulsatile expression of the microRNA (miRNA) lin-4 maintains the temporal gradient of its target lin-14 by dampening its expression oscillations. Our results demonstrate that this insulation is optimal when pulsatile expression of the miRNA and its target is synchronous. We propose that such a miRNA-mediated incoherent feed-forward loop is a potent filter that prevents the propagation of potentially deleterious fluctuations in gene expression during the development of an organism.

24037528	Title	MiR-200 can repress breast cancer metastasis through ZEB1-independent but moesin-dependent pathways.
24037528	Abstract	The microRNA-200 (miR-200) family has a critical role in regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cancer cell invasion through inhibition of the E-cadherin transcriptional repressors ZEB1 and ZEB2. Recent studies have indicated that the miR-200 family may exert their effects at distinct stages in the metastatic process, with an overall effect of enhancing metastasis in a syngeneic mouse breast cancer model. We find in a xenograft orthotopic model of breast cancer metastasis that ectopic expression of members of the miR-200b/200c/429, but not the miR-141/200a, functional groups limits tumour cell invasion and metastasis. Despite modulation of the ZEB1-E-cadherin axis, restoration of ZEB1 in miR-200b-expressing cells was not able to alter metastatic potential suggesting that other targets contribute to this process. Instead, we found that miR-200b repressed several actin-associated genes, with the knockdown of the ezrin-radixin-moesin family member moesin alone phenocopying the repression of cell invasion by miR-200b. Moesin was verified to be directly targeted by miR-200b, and restoration of moesin in miR-200b-expressing cells was sufficient to alleviate metastatic repression. In breast cancer cell lines and patient samples, the expression of moesin significantly inversely correlated with miR-200 expression, and high levels of moesin were associated with poor relapse-free survival. These findings highlight the context-dependent effects of miR-200 in breast cancer metastasis and demonstrate the existence of a moesin-dependent pathway, distinct from the ZEB1-E-cadherin axis, through which miR-200 can regulate tumour cell plasticity and metastasis.

24037530	Title	miR-93-directed downregulation of DAB2 defines a novel oncogenic pathway in lung cancer.
24037530	Abstract	The disabled homolog 2 (DAB2) gene was recently identified as a tumor suppressor gene with its expression downregulated in multiple cancer types. The role of DAB2 in lung tumorigenesis, however, is not fully characterized, and the mechanisms of DAB2 dysregulation in lung cancer are not defined. Here we show that low DAB2 levels in lung tumor specimens are significantly correlated with poor patient survival, and that DAB2 overexpression significantly inhibits cell growth in cultured lung cancer cells, indicating its potent tumor suppressor function. We next identify that microRNA miR-93 functions as a potent repressor of DAB2 expression by directly targeting the 3'UTR of the DAB2 mRNA. Using in vitro and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that miR-93 overexpression has an important role in promoting lung cancer cell growth, and that its oncogenic function is primarily mediated by downregulating DAB2 expression. Our clinical investigations further indicate that high tumor levels of miR-93 are correlated with poor survival of lung cancer patients. The correlations of both low DAB2 and high miR-93 expression levels with poor patient survival strongly support the critical role of the miR-93/DAB2 pathway in determining lung cancer progression.

24037531	Title	Androgen receptor and microRNA-21 axis downregulates transforming growth factor beta receptor II (TGFBR2) expression in prostate cancer.
24037531	Abstract	Prostate cancer cells escape growth inhibition from transforming growth factor Beta (TGFBeta) by downregulating TGFBeta receptors. However, the mechanism by which cancer cells downregulate TGFBeta receptors in prostate is not clear. Here, we showed that coordinated action of miR-21 and androgen receptor (AR) signaling had a critical role in inhibiting TGFBeta receptor II (TGFBR2) expression in prostate cancer cells. Our results revealed that miR-21 suppresses TGFBR2 levels by binding to its 3'-UTR and AR signaling further potentiates this effect in both untransformed and transformed human prostate epithelial cells as well as in human prostate cancers. Analysis of primary prostate cancers showed that increased miR-21/AR expression parallel a significantly reduced expression of TGFBR2. Manipulation of androgen signaling or the expression levels of AR or miR-21 negatively altered TGFBR2 expression in untransformed and transformed human prostate epithelial cells, human prostate cancer xenografts and mouse prostate glands. Importantly, we demonstrated that miR-21 and AR regulated each other's expression resulting in a positive feedback loop. Our results indicated that miR-21/AR mediate its tumor-promoting function by attenuating TGFBeta-mediated Smad2/3 activation, cell growth inhibition, cell migration and apoptosis. Together, these results suggest that the AR and miR-21 axis exerts its oncogenic effects in prostate tumors by downregulating TGFBR2, hence inhibiting the tumor-suppressive activity of TGFBeta pathway. Targeting miR-21 alone or in combination with AR may restore the tumor inhibitory activity of TGFBeta in prostate cancer.

24038073	Title	Reciprocal regulation of microRNA-122 and c-Myc in hepatocellular cancer: role of E2F1 and transcription factor dimerization partner 2.
24038073	Abstract	c-Myc is a well-known oncogene frequently up-regulated in different malignancies, whereas liver-specific microRNA (miR)-122, a bona fide tumor suppressor, is down-regulated in hepatocellular cancer (HCC). Here we explored the underlying mechanism of reciprocal regulation of these two genes. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and northern blot analysis demonstrated reduced expression of the primary, precursor, and mature miR-122 in c-MYC-induced HCCs compared to the benign livers, indicating transcriptional suppression of miR-122 upon MYC overexpression. Indeed, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay showed significantly reduced association of RNA polymerase II and histone H3K9Ac, markers of active chromatin, with the miR-122 promoter in tumors relative to the c-MYC-uninduced livers, indicating transcriptional repression of miR-122 in c-MYC-overexpressing tumors. The ChIP assay also demonstrated a significant increase in c-Myc association with the miR-122 promoter region that harbors a conserved noncanonical c-Myc binding site in tumors compared to the livers. Ectopic expression and knockdown studies showed that c-Myc indeed suppresses expression of primary and mature miR-122 in hepatic cells. Additionally, Hnf-3Beta, a liver enriched transcription factor that activates miR-122 gene, was suppressed in c-MYC-induced tumors. Notably, miR-122 also repressed c-Myc transcription by targeting transcriptional activator E2f1 and coactivator Tfdp2, as evident from ectopic expression and knockdown studies and luciferase reporter assays in mouse and human hepatic cells. c-Myc represses miR-122 gene expression by associating with its promoter and by down-regulating Hnf-3Beta expression, whereas miR-122 indirectly inhibits c-Myc transcription by targeting Tfdp2 and E2f1. In essence, these results suggest a double-negative feedback loop between a tumor suppressor (miR-122) and an oncogene (c-Myc).

24038201	Title	miR-34c enhances mouse spermatogonial stem cells differentiation by targeting Nanos2.
24038201	Abstract	miRNAs are expressed in many mammalian cells, acting specific roles in regulating gene expression or mediating special mRNAs cleavage by targeting their 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR). Some miRNAs are essential and important for animal development. However, it is still unclear what the relationship is between miR-34c and mammalian spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). We found that a conserved microRNA-34c through its target-Nanos2, regulating SSCs' differentiation in mouse. Immunohistochemistry analysis of Nanos2 and miR-34c FISH results revealed the opposite expression trends between them. Seven bioinformatics websites and programs predicted that miR-34c has interaction sites in Nanos2's 3'UTR. Dual-luciferase reporter vector and mutated dual-luciferase reporter vector analysis validated that they are interacted. After transfection miR-34c mimics into mouse SSCs, or miR-34c lentiviral vector in vitro co-cultivation with seminiferous tubules, and Western blot analysis demonstrated that miR-34c over-expression could suppress Nanos2 expression in post-transcription level. Our experiments identified that miR-34c may promote meiosis process by interacting with Nanos2 leading up-regulation of Stra8 in mouse spermatogonial stem cells.

24038379	Title	miR-495 enhances the sensitivity of non-small cell lung cancer cells to platinum by modulation of copper-transporting P-type adenosine triphosphatase A (ATP7A).
24038379	Abstract	Copper-transporting P-type adenosine triphosphatase A (ATP7A) is associated with platinum drug resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). microRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level. In this study, the aim is to explore which miRNAs might participate in the platinum resistance by targeting ATP7A in NSCLC. Using real-time PCR-based miRNA expression profiling and bioinformatics, we selected miR-495 as a candidate miRNA. EGFP reporter assay, real-time PCR, and Western blot validated that ATP7A was a direct target for miR-495. The drug sensitivity assay indicated that miR-495 enhanced the cell response to cisplatin (CDDP) in NSCLC cells, while inhibition of miR-495 led to the opposite effects. Importantly, either overexpression or knockdown of ATP7A could override the effect of miR-495 on chemosensitivity. We also demonstrated that miR-495 increased the intracellular CDDP accumulation and overexpression of ATP7A can reduce the increased drug concentration induced by miR-495. Finally, we discovered that there was a converse relationship between miR-495 and ATP7A levels in NSCLC tissues sensitive or resistant to CDDP. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that miR-495 regulates the multi-drug resistance by modulation of ATP7A expression in NSCLC and suggest that miR-495 may serve as a potential biomarker for the treatment of multi-drug resistant NSCLC patients with high ATP7A levels.

24038414	Title	Effect and possible mechanism of network between microRNAs and RUNX2 gene on human dental follicle cells.
24038414	Abstract	To investigate whether crosstalk between RUNX2 and miRNAs is involved in tooth eruption regulated by dental follicle cells (DFCs) and the possible molecular mechanism. Blood samples and embedded dental follicles were collected from patients with cleidocranial dysplasia, and RUNX2 gene mutations were analyzed, then RUNX2(+/m) DFCs were isolated and identified. The characteristics of RUNX2(+/m) DFCs were analyzed. The differential expression of miRNAs was detected between the RUNX2(+/m) DFCs and RUNX2(+/+) DFCs by microarray, and target genes were predicted by miRGen. miR-146a was chosen for further investigation, and its effects in DFCs were analyzed by transfecting its mimics and inhibitors, and expression of genes involved in tooth eruption were detected. A novel insertion mutation (c.309_310insTG) of RUNX2 gene was identified which had an effect on the characteristics of DFCs. Compared with the RUNX2(+/+) DFCs, there were 69 microRNAs more than twofold up-regulated and 54 microRNAs more than twofold down-regulated in the RUNX2(+/m) DFCs. Among these, miR-146a decreased significantly in RUNX2(+/m) DFCs, and expression of RUNX2, CSF-1, EGFR, and OPG was significantly altered when miR-146a was overexpressed or inhibited. RUNX2 gene mutation contributes to the characteristic change of DFCs, and the crosstalk between RUNX2 gene and miRNAs may be one of the key regulatory mechanisms of differentiation of DFCs.

24039126	Title	Differential methylation of the micro-RNA 7b gene targets postnatal maturation of murine neuronal Mecp2 gene expression.
24039126	Abstract	DNA methylation and microRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in maturation of postnatal mouse neurons. Aberrant DNA methylation and/or altered miRNA expression cause postnatal neurodevelopmental disorders. In general, DNA methylation in the 5'-flanking region suppresses gene expression through recruitment of methyl-CpG binding domain proteins (MBPs) to the cytosine residues of CpG dinucleotides. X-linked MeCP2 (methyl-CpG binding protein 2), a member of MBPs, is a methylation-associated transcriptional repressor with other functions in the central nervous system (CNS). miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR). Some miRNA genes harboring or being embedded in CpG islands undergo methylation-mediated silencing. One such miRNA is miR-7b which is differentially expressed through stages of neurodevelopment. In our present study, we focused on a canonical CpG island located in the 5'-flanking region of the murine miR-7b gene. Hypermethylation of this CpG island down-regulates miR-7b while recruiting MeCP2 to the methylated CpG dinucleotides. Meanwhile, Mecp2, a target of miR-7b, was up-regulated due to lack of restrain exerted by miR-7b during maturation of postnatal (PN) mouse neurons between PN3 and PN14. Our results indicate that miR-7b is a direct downstream gene transcriptional target while also being a negative post-transcriptional regulator of Mecp2 expression. We speculate that this bidirectional feed-back autoregulatory function of miR-7b and Mecp2 while linking DNA methylation and miRNA action maintains the homeostatic control of gene expression necessary during postnatal maturation of mammalian neurons.

24039836	Title	Downregulation of miR-151-5p contributes to increased susceptibility to arrhythmogenesis during myocardial infarction with estrogen deprivation.
24039836	Abstract	Estrogen deficiency is associated with increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases. But merely estrogen supplementary treatment can induce many severe complications such as breast cancer. The present study was designed to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying increased susceptibility of arrhythmogenesis during myocardial infarction with estrogen deprivation, which provides us a new target to cure cardiac disease accompanied with estrogen deprivation. We successfully established a rat model of myocardial ischemia (MI) accompanied with estrogen deprivation by coronary artery ligation and ovariectomy (OVX). Vulnerability and mortality of ventricular arrhythmias increased in estrogen deficiency rats compared to non estrogen deficiency rats when suffered MI, which was associated with down-regulation of microRNA-151-5p (miR-151-5p). Luciferase Reporter Assay demonstrated that miR-151-5p can bind to the 3'-UTR of FXYD1 (coding gene of phospholemman, PLM) and inhibit its expression. We found that the expression of PLM was increased in (OVX+MI) group compared with MI group. More changes such as down-regulation of Kir2.1/IK1, calcium overload had emerged in (OVX+MI) group compared to MI group merely. Transfection of miR-151-5p into primary cultured myocytes decreased PLM levels and [Ca(2+)]i, however, increased Kir2.1 levels. These effects were abolished by the antisense oligonucleotides against miR-151-5p. Co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent experiments confirmed the co-localization between Kir2.1 and PLM in rat ventricular tissue. We conclude that the increased ventricular arrhythmias vulnerability in response to acute myocardial ischemia in rat is critically dependent upon down-regulation of miR-151-5p. These findings support the proposal that miR-151-5p could be a potential therapeutic target for the prevention of ischemic arrhythmias in the subjects with estrogen deficiency.

24039891	Title	Beta cell 5'-shifted isomiRs are candidate regulatory hubs in type 2 diabetes.
24039891	Abstract	Next-generation deep sequencing of small RNAs has unveiled the complexity of the microRNA (miRNA) transcriptome, which is in large part due to the diversity of miRNA sequence variants ("isomiRs"). Changes to a miRNA's seed sequence (nucleotides 2-8), including shifted start positions, can redirect targeting to a dramatically different set of RNAs and alter biological function. We performed deep sequencing of small RNA from mouse insulinoma (MIN6) cells (widely used as a surrogate for the study of pancreatic beta cells) and developed a bioinformatic analysis pipeline to profile isomiR diversity. Additionally, we applied the pipeline to recently published small RNA-seq data from primary human beta cells and whole islets and compared the miRNA profiles with that of MIN6. We found that: (1) the miRNA expression profile in MIN6 cells is highly correlated with those of primary human beta cells and whole islets; (2) miRNA loci can generate multiple highly expressed isomiRs with different 5'-start positions (5'-isomiRs); (3) isomiRs with shifted start positions (5'-shifted isomiRs) are highly expressed, and can be as abundant as their unshifted counterparts (5'-reference miRNAs). Finally, we identified 10 beta cell miRNA families as candidate regulatory hubs in a type 2 diabetes (T2D) gene network. The most significant candidate hub was miR-29, which we demonstrated regulates the mRNA levels of several genes critical to beta cell function and implicated in T2D. Three of the candidate miRNA hubs were novel 5'-shifted isomiRs: miR-375+1, miR-375-1 and miR-183-5p+1. We showed by in silico target prediction and in vitro transfection studies that both miR-375+1 and miR-375-1 are likely to target an overlapping, but distinct suite of beta cell genes compared to canonical miR-375. In summary, this study characterizes the isomiR profile in beta cells for the first time, and also highlights the potential functional relevance of 5'-shifted isomiRs to T2D.

24039954	Title	New target genes of MITF-induced microRNA-211 contribute to melanoma cell invasion.
24039954	Abstract	The non-coding microRNAs (miRNA) have tissue- and disease-specific expression patterns. They down-regulate target mRNAs, which likely impacts on most fundamental cellular processes. Differential expression patterns of miRNAs are currently being exploited for identification of biomarkers for early disease diagnosis, prediction of progression for melanoma and other cancers and as promising drug targets, since they can easily be inhibited or replaced in a given cellular context. Before successfully manipulating miRNAs in clinical settings, their precise expression levels, endogenous functions and thus their target genes have to be determined. MiR-211, a melanocyte lineage-specific small non-coding miRNA, is located in an intron of TRPM1, a target gene of the microphtalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). By transcriptionally up-regulating TRPM1, MITF, which is critical for both melanocyte differentiation and survival and for melanoma progression, indirectly drives the expression of miR-211. Expression of this miRNA is often reduced in melanoma samples. Here, we investigated functional roles of miR-211 by identifying and studying new target genes. We show that MITF-correlated miR-211 expression levels are mostly but not always reduced in a panel of 11 melanoma cell lines and in primary and metastatic melanoma compared to normal melanocytes and nevi, respectively. MiR-211 itself only marginally impacted on cell invasion and migration, while perturbation of some new miR-211 target genes, such as AP1S2, SOX11, IGFBP5, and SERINC3 significantly increased invasion. These results and the variable expression levels of miR-211 raise serious doubts on the value of miR-211 as a melanoma tumor-suppressing miRNA and/or as a biomarker for melanoma.

24039995	Title	miR-140 suppresses tumor growth and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer by targeting insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor.
24039995	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNA molecules that play important roles in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. In this study, we investigated the roles and mechanisms of miR-140 in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We found that miR-140 is significantly downregulated in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that miR-140 suppresses NSCLC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro. Importantly, overexpression of miR-140 effectively repressed tumor growth and metastasis in nude mouse models. Integrated analysis identified IGF1R as a direct and functional target of miR-140. Knockdown of IGF1R inhibited cell proliferation and invasion resembling that of miR-140 overexpression, while overexpression of IGF1R attenuated the function of miR-140 in NSCLC cells. Together, our results highlight the significance of miR-140 and IGF1R in the development and progression of NSCLC.

24040069	Title	Cell-specific post-transcriptional regulation of Gamma-synuclein gene by micro-RNAs.
24040069	Abstract	Gamma-Synuclein is a member of the synucleins family of small proteins, which consists of three members:Alpha, Beta- and Gamma-synuclein. Gamma-Synuclein is abnormally expressed in a high percentage of advanced and metastatic tumors, but not in normal or benign tissues. Furthermore, Gamma-synuclein expression is strongly correlated with disease progression, and can stimulate proliferation, induce invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. Gamma-Synuclein transcription is regulated basically through the binding of AP-1 to specific sequences in intron 1. Here we show that Gamma-synuclein expression may be also regulated by micro RNAs (miRs) on post-transcriptional level. According to prediction by several methods, the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of Gamma-synuclein gene contains targets for miRs. Insertion of Gamma-synuclein 3'-UTR downstream of the reporter luciferase (LUC) gene causes a 51% reduction of LUC activity after transfection into SKBR3 and Y79 cells, confirming the presence of efficient targets for miRs in this fragment. Expression of miR-4437 and miR-4674 for which putative targets in 3'-UTR were predicted caused a 61.2% and 60.1% reduction of endogenous Gamma-synuclein expression confirming their role in gene expression regulation. On the other hand, in cells overexpressing Gamma-synuclein no significant effect of miRs on Gamma-synuclein expression was found suggesting that miRs exert their regulatory effect only at low or moderate, but not at high level of Gamma-synuclein expression. Elevated level of Gamma-synuclein differentially changes the level of several miRs expression, upregulating the level of some miRs and downregulating the level of others. Three miRs upregulated as a result of Gamma-synuclein overexpression, i.e., miR-885-3p, miR-138 and miR-497 have putative targets in 3'-UTR of the Gamma-synuclein gene. Some of miRs differentially regulated by Gamma-synuclein may modulate signaling pathways and cancer related gene expression. This study demonstrates that miRs might provide cell-specific regulation of Gamma-synuclein expression and set the stage to further evaluate their role in pathophysiological processes.

24040120	Title	DCLK1 regulates pluripotency and angiogenic factors via microRNA-dependent mechanisms in pancreatic cancer.
24040120	Abstract	Stem cell pluripotency, angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) have been shown to be significantly upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and many other aggressive cancers. The dysregulation of these processes is believed to play key roles in tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis, and is contributory to PDAC being the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the US. The tumor suppressor miRNA miR-145 downregulates critical pluripotency factors and oncogenes and results in repressed metastatic potential in PDAC. Additionally, the miR-200 family regulates several angiogenic factors which have been linked to metastasis in many solid tumors. We have previously demonstrated that downregulation of DCLK1 can upregulate critical miRNAs in both in vitro and in vivo cancer models and results in downregulation of c-MYC, KRAS, NOTCH1 and EMT-related transcription factors. A recent report has also shown that Dclk1 can distinguish between normal and tumor stem cells in Apc (min/+) mice and that ablation of Dclk1(+) cells resulted in regression of intestinal polyps without affecting homeostasis. Here we demonstrate that the knockdown of DCLK1 using poly(lactide-co-glycolide)-encapsulated-DCLK1-siRNA results in AsPC1 tumor growth arrest. Examination of xenograft tumors revealed, (a) increased miR-145 which results in decreased pluripotency maintenance factors OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4 as well as KRAS and RREB1; (b) increased let-7a which results in decreased pluripotency factor LIN28B; and (c) increased miR-200 which results in decreased VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and EMT-related transcription factors ZEB1, ZEB2, SNAIL and SLUG. Specificity of DCLK1 post-transcriptional regulation of the downstream targets of miR-145, miR-200 and let-7a was accomplished utilizing a luciferase-based reporter assay. We conclude that DCLK1 plays a significant master regulatory role in pancreatic tumorigenesis through the regulation of multiple tumor suppressor miRNAs and their downstream pro-tumorigenic pathways. This novel concept of targeting DCLK1 alone has several advantages over targeting single pathway or miRNA-based therapies for PDAC.

24040263	Title	MiR-499 regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis during late-stage cardiac differentiation via Sox6 and cyclin D1.
24040263	Abstract	MiR-499 is a cardiac-abundant miRNA. However, the biological functions of miR-499 in differentiated cardiomyocytes or in the cardiomyocyte differentiation process is not very clear. Sox6 is believed to be one of its targets, and is also believed to play a role in cardiac differentiation. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the association between Sox6 and miR-499 during cardiac differentiation. Using a well-established in vitro cardiomyocyte differentiation system, mouse P19CL6 cells, we found that miR-499 was highly expressed in the late stage of cardiac differentiation. In cells stably transfected with miR-499 (P-499 cells), it was found that miR-499 could promote the differentiation into cardiomyocytes at the early stage of cardiac differentiation. Notably, cell viability assay, EdU incorporation assay, and cell cycle profile analysis all showed that the P-499 cells displayed the distinctive feature of hyperplastic growth. Further investigation confirmed that miR-499 could promote neonatal rat cardiomyocyte proliferation. MiR-499 knock-down enhanced apoptosis in the late differentiation stage in P19CL6 cells, but overexpression of miR-499 resulted in a decrease in the apoptosis rate. Sox6 was identified as a direct target of miR-499 and its expression was detected from day 8 or day 10 of cardiac differentiation of P19CL6 cells. Sox6 played a role in cell viability, inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis in P19CL6 cells and cardiomyocytes. The overexpression of Sox6 could reverse the proliferation and anti-apoptosis effects of miR-499. It was also found that miR-499 might exert its function by regulating cyclin D1 via its influence on Sox6. miR-499 probably regulates the proliferation and apoptosis of P19CL6 cells in the late stage of cardiac differentiation via its effects on Sox6 and cyclin D1.

24040336	Title	Reduction of microRNA-206 contributes to the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia through up-regulation of fibronectin 1.
24040336	Abstract	To characterize microRNA-206 (miR-206) in the development of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). We assessed the expression of miR-206 in BPD mouse lung tissues and blood samples of BPD patients by quantitative real-time PCR. Then, the role of miR-206 in regulating cell biology were examined by XTT assay, flow cytometry, transwell invasion assay, wound healing assay and adhesion assay in vitro. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay, real-time PCR, western blot and Immunofluorescence staining were performed to figure out the target gene of miR-206. A reduction in expression of miR-206 was observed in BPD mice compared with controls and in BPD patients compared with controls. miR-206 overexpression significantly induced cell apoptosis, reduced cell proliferation, migration and adhesion abilities, whereas the inhibition of miR-206 expression had the opposite effect. Fibronectin 1 (FN1) is a direct target of miR-206, and fn 1 can be transcriptionally and translationally regulated by miR-206. Down-regulation of miR-206 modulates biological functions of the cells, at least in part, by increasing the level of fn 1. Furthermore, fn 1 expression levels were increased in the BPD mice and BPD patients. The expression of miR-206 and its target gene, fn 1, may contribute to the progression of BPD.

24040406	Title	The Wnt/Beta-catenin pathway regulates the expression of the miR-302 cluster in mouse ESCs and P19 cells.
24040406	Abstract	MicroRNAs of the miR-302 cluster are involved in early embryonic development and somatic cell reprogramming. Expression of the miR-302 gene is regulated by the binding of the pluripotency factors Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog to the miR-302 promoter. The specific expression pattern of the miR-302 gene suggested that additional transcription factors might be involved in its regulation. Here, we show that the miR-302 promoter is a direct target of the Wnt/Beta-catenin signaling pathway. We found that the miR-302 promoter contains three different functional Tcf/Lef binding sites. Two of the three sites were located within the cluster of Oct4/Sox2/Nanog binding sites and were essential for Wnt/Beta-catenin-mediated regulation of the miR-302 gene. Tcf3, the only Tcf/Lef factor that bound to the miR-302 promoter, acted as a repressor of miR-302 transcription. Interestingly, mutations in the two Tcf/Lef binding sites and the Oct4/Nanog binding sites abolished miR-302 promoter responsiveness to Wnt signaling, suggesting that the Tcf/Lef and the Oct4/Nanog sites interact genetically.

24043765	Title	VEGF controls lung Th2 inflammation via the miR-1-Mpl (myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene)-P-selectin axis.
24043765	Abstract	Asthma, the prototypic Th2-mediated inflammatory disorder of the lung, is an emergent disease worldwide. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a critical regulator of pulmonary Th2 inflammation, but the underlying mechanism and the roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in this process have not been defined. Here we show that lung-specific overexpression of VEGF decreases miR-1 expression in the lung, most prominently in the endothelium, and a similar down-regulation occurs in lung endothelium in Th2 inflammation models. Intranasal delivery of miR-1 inhibited inflammatory responses to ovalbumin, house dust mite, and IL-13 overexpression. Blocking VEGF inhibited Th2-mediated lung inflammation, and this was restored by antagonizing miR-1. Using mRNA arrays, Argonaute pull-down assays, luciferase expression assays, and mutational analysis, we identified Mpl as a direct target of miR-1 and showed that VEGF controls the expression of endothelial Mpl during Th2 inflammation via the regulation of miR-1. In vivo knockdown of Mpl inhibited Th2 inflammation and indirectly inhibited the expression of P-selectin in lung endothelium. These experiments define a novel VEGF-miR-1-Mpl-P-selectin effector pathway in lung Th2 inflammation and herald the utility of miR-1 and Mpl as potential therapeutic targets for asthma.

24046120	Title	Up-regulation of NEK2 by microRNA-128 methylation is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer.
24046120	Abstract	NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2), an enzyme involved in the development and progression of cancer, is abnormally expressed in a wide variety of human cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC), and is known to have roles in cell division and mitotic regulation through centrosome splitting. We investigated the clinical significance of NEK2 in CRC. In particular, we examined miR-128 expression, which is thought to target NEK2. We measured NEK2 mRNA and miR-128 levels in clinical samples by quantitative reverse transcription real-time PCR and analyzed the associations between NEK2 levels, miR-128 levels, clinicopathological factors, and prognoses. Furthermore, we performed in vitro assays using a pre-miR-128 precursor and conducted miR-128 methylation analyses. MiR-128 inhibited NEK2 expression and cancer cell proliferation via cell cycle arrest. Moreover, miR-128 was silenced by DNA methylation. Increased NEK2 expression was associated with serosal invasion, lymphatic invasion, and peritoneal dissemination. Patients with high NEK2 expression also had significantly poorer prognoses. Multivariate analysis indicated that high NEK2 expression was an independent prognostic factor for survival. Patients with high miR-128 expression had significantly lower NEK2 expression and lower recurrence rates than those with low miR-128 expression. NEK2 may be an independent prognostic factor for CRC and was regulated by miR-128, a microRNA that was subjected to epigenetic regulation. Thus, this miR-128/NEK2 pathway may be a prospective therapeutic target for patients with CRC.

24046434	Title	A signature of circulating microRNAs differentiates takotsubo cardiomyopathy from acute myocardial infarction.
24046434	Abstract	Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TTC) remains a potentially life-threatening disease, which is clinically indistinguishable from acute myocardial infarction (MI). Today, no established biomarkers are available for the early diagnosis of TTC and differentiation from MI. MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) emerge as promising sensitive and specific biomarkers for cardiovascular disease. Thus, we sought to identify circulating miRNAs suitable for diagnosis of acute TTC and for distinguishing TTC from acute MI. After miRNA profiling, eight miRNAs were selected for verification by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in patients with TTC (n = 36), ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (STEMI, n = 27), and healthy controls (n = 28). We quantitatively confirmed up-regulation of miR-16 and miR-26a in patients with TTC compared with healthy subjects (both, P < 0.001), and up-regulation of miR-16, miR-26a, and let-7f compared with STEMI patients (P < 0.0001, P < 0.05, and P < 0.05, respectively). Consistent with previous publications, cardiac specific miR-1 and miR-133a were up-regulated in STEMI patients compared with healthy controls (both, P < 0.0001). Moreover, miR-133a was substantially increased in patients with STEMI compared with TTC (P < 0.05). A unique signature comprising miR-1, miR-16, miR-26a, and miR-133a differentiated TTC from healthy subjects [area under the curve (AUC) 0.835, 95% CI 0.733-0.937, P < 0.0001] and from STEMI patients (AUC 0.881, 95% CI 0.793-0.968, P < 0.0001). This signature yielded a sensitivity of 74.19% and a specificity of 78.57% for TTC vs. healthy subjects, and a sensitivity of 96.77% and a specificity of 70.37% for TTC vs. STEMI patients. Additionally, we noticed a decrease of the endothelin-1 (ET-1)-regulating miRNA-125a-5p in parallel with a robust increase of ET-1 plasma levels in TTC compared with healthy subjects (P < 0.05). The present study for the first time describes a signature of four circulating miRNAs as a robust biomarker to distinguish TTC from STEMI patients. The significant up-regulation of these stress- and depression-related miRNAs suggests a close connection of TTC with neuropsychiatric disorders. Moreover, decreased levels of miRNA125a-5p as well as increased plasma levels of its target ET-1 are in line with the microvascular spasm hypothesis of the TTC pathomechanism.

24054006	Title	[Relationship between the expression level of miR-29c and biological behavior of gastric cancer].
24054006	Abstract	To study the function and clinicopathological significance of RNA-29c (miR-29c) in the carcinogenesis and development of gastric cancer. MicroRNA microarray was applied to assess the miRNAs expression profile of gastric cancer. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to detect the expression of miR-29c in 64 cases of gastric cancer tissues and corresponding normal gastric epithelium, as well as cell lines GES-1, BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells. MTT assay and flow cytometry were applied to detect the effects of forced expression of miR-29c in gastric cancer BGC-823 cells including cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle and drug sensitivity. Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot and luciferase reporter assay were used to explore the targeted relationship between miR-29c and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1). Compared with normal gastric epithelium, seven microRNAs (miR-374b*, miRPlus-E1212, miR-338-5p, miR-297, miR-21, miR-135b, miR-18a) were significantly up-regulated more than 2-folds, and nine microRNAs (miR-29b-2*, miR-1260, miRPlus-E1241, miR-S1-5p, miR-148a, miR-29c, miR-647, miR-196b*, ebv-miR-BART5) were significantly down-reguated in gastric cancer tissues. The average expression level of miR-29c in gastric cancer tissues was 0.70 +- 0.34 and in corresponding normal epithelium was 1.00 +- 0.06 (P < 0.05). miR-29c expression was related to tumor size, lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, Laurén classification, Borrmann classification and Ming classification (P < 0.05). The poorer differentiation degree of gastric cell lines, the lower was miR-29c expression level (P < 0.05). Overexpression of miR-29c in gastric cancer BGC-823 cells suppressed cell proliferation, stimulated cell apoptosis, induced cell cycle arrest in S phase and increased the chemotherapy sensitivity to drug docetaxel (all were P < 0.05). The average expression level of Mcl-1 mRNA in gastric cancer tissues was 3.47 +- 1.34 and corresponding epithelialium was 1.00 +- 0.20 (P < 0.05). The expression level of miR-29c was negatively related with that of Mcl-1 mRNA in gastric cancer tissues. miR-29c directly targeted to regulation of Mcl-1 expression. There are special miRNA expression profile in gastric cancer. The expression of miR-29c is closely related to biological behavior of human gastric cancer. miR-29c is involved in targeted regulation of Mcl-1, and may be one of mechanisms of the carcinogenesis of gastric cancer.

24055140	Title	CRKL promotes cell proliferation in gastric cancer and is negatively regulated by miR-126.
24055140	Abstract	V-crk avian sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene homolog-like (CRKL) is a member of CRK family and act as an adaptor protein participating in intra-cellular signal transduction. The role of CRKL in gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear. In this study, we show that CRKL was aberrantly highly expressed in both GC tumor specimens and cell lines (SGC-7901, MKN-45, MKN-28 and SUN-16). The expression of CRKL was significantly correlated with GC clinicopathologic features including tumor size, local invasion, lymph node metastasis and TNM stages. Knock-down of CRKL in SGC-7901 cells induced a suppression of cell proliferation along with a significant arrest of cell cycle in G0/G1 phase, however, no significant influence was observed on cell apoptosis. We validate that miR-126, a suppressor in GC, was a negative regulator of CRKL by directly combining with the 3' untranslated region of CRKL mRNA, and over-expression of miR-126 inhibited the protein expression of CRKL significantly. These results suggest that CRKL may function as an oncogene in GC by promoting the GC cell proliferation, which provides us a likely biomarker and a potential target for GC prevention, diagnosis and therapeutic treatment. Moreover, the targeting relationship between CRKL and miR-126 partly reveals the mechanism of miR-126 on GC suppression.

24055276	Title	Hormonal regulation of beta-catenin during development of the avian oviduct and its expression in epithelial cell-derived ovarian carcinogenesis.
24055276	Abstract	Beta-catenin (CTNNB1) is a dual function molecule that acts as a key component of the cadherin complex and WNT signaling pathway. It has a crucial role in embryogenesis, tumorigenesis, angiogenesis and progression of metastasis. Recently, it has been suggested that the CTNNB1 complex is a major regulator of development of the mouse oviduct and uterus. However, little is known about the CTNNB1 gene in chickens. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the CTNNB1 gene in the chicken reproductive tract and hormonal control of its expression in the chicken oviduct. CTNNB1 was localized specifically to the luminal and glandular epithelium of the four segments of chicken oviduct and DES (diethylstilbestrol, a synthetic non-steroidal estrogen) increased its expression primarily in LE of the magnum. In addition, CTNNB1 mRNA and protein were expressed abundantly in glandular epithelium of endometrioid-type ovarian carcinoma, but not in normal ovaries. Moreover, CTNNB1 expression was post-transcriptionally regulated via its 3'-UTR by binding with target miRNAs including miR-217, miR-1467, miR-1623 and miR-1697. Collectively, these results indicate that CTNNB1 is a novel gene regulated by estrogen in epithelial cells of the chicken oviduct and that it is also abundantly expressed in epithelial cells of endometrioid-type ovarian carcinoma suggesting that it could be used as a marker for diagnosis of ovarian cancer in laying hens and women.

24055727	Title	Growth inhibitory effects of three miR-129 family members on gastric cancer.
24055727	Abstract	Reduced expression of microRNA-129 (miR-129) has been reported in several types of tumor cell lines as well as in primary tumor tissues. However, little is known about how miR-129 affects cell proliferation in gastric cancer. Here, we show that all miR-129 family members, miR-129-1-3p, miR-129-2-3p, and miR-129-5p, are down-regulated in gastric cancer cell lines compared with normal gastric epithelial cells. Furthermore, using the real-time cell analyzer assay to observe the growth effects of miR-129 on gastric cancer cells, we found that all three mature products of miR-129 showed tumor suppressor activities. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying down-regulation of miR-129 in gastric cancer, we analyzed the effects of miR-129 mimics on the cell cycle. We found that increased miR-129 levels in gastric cancer cells resulted in significant G0/G1 phase arrest. Interestingly, we showed that cyclin dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), a cell cycle-associated protein involved in G1-S transition, was a target of miR-129. We also found that expression of the sex determining region Y-box 4 (SOX4) was inversely associated with that of miR-129-2-3p and miR-129-5p but not of miR-129-1-3p. Together, our data indicate that all miR-129 family members, not only miR-129-5p, as previously thought, play an important role in regulating cell proliferation in gastric cancer.

24056962	Title	miR-26a enhances miRNA biogenesis by targeting Lin28B and Zcchc11 to suppress tumor growth and metastasis.
24056962	Abstract	Human cancers often exhibit attenuated microRNA (miRNA) biogenesis and global underexpression of miRNAs; thus, targeting the miRNA biogenesis pathway represents a novel strategy for cancer therapy. Here, we report that miR-26a enhances miRNA biogenesis, which acts as a common mechanism partially accounting for miR-26a function in diverse cancers including melanoma, prostate and liver cancer. miR-26a was broadly reduced in multiple cancers, and overexpression of miR-26a significantly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo, including melanoma, prostate and liver cancers. Notably, miR-26a overexpression was accompanied by global upregulation of miRNAs, especially let-7, and let-7 expression was concordant with miR-26a expression in cancer cell lines, xenograft tumors and normal human tissues, underscoring their biological relevance. We showed that miR-26a directly targeted Lin28B and Zcchc11-two critical repressors of let-7 maturation. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Zcchc11 promoted tumor growth and metastasis, and it was prominently overexpressed in human cancers. Our findings thus provide a novel mechanism by which a miRNA acts as a modulator of miRNA biogenesis. These results also define a role of the miR-26a and Zcchc11 in tumorigenesis and metastasis and have implications to develop new strategies for cancer therapy.

24057215	Title	MiR-138 downregulates miRNA processing in HeLa cells by targeting RMND5A and decreasing Exportin-5 stability.
24057215	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding small RNAs that consist of ≈ 22 nt and are involved in several biological processes by regulating target gene expression. MiR-138 has many biological functions and is often downregulated in cancers. Our results showed that overexpression of miR-138 downregulated target RMND5A (required for meiotic nuclear division 5 homolog A) and reduced Exportin-5 stability, which results in decreased levels of pre-miRNA nuclear export in HeLa cells. We also found that miR-138 could significantly inhibit HeLa cell migration by targeting RMND5A. Our study therefore identifies miR-138-RMND5A-Exportin-5 as a previously unknown miRNA processing regulatory pathway in HeLa cells.

24058689	Title	Dual regulation of the lin-14 target mRNA by the lin-4 miRNA.
24058689	Abstract	microRNAs (miRNAs) are ∼22 nt regulatory RNAs that in animals typically bind with partial complementarity to sequences in the 3' untranslated (UTR) regions of target mRNAs, to induce a decrease in the production of the encoded protein. The relative contributions of translational inhibition of intact mRNAs and degradation of mRNAs caused by binding of the miRNA vary; for many genetically validated miRNA targets, translational repression has been implicated, whereas some analyses of other miRNA targets have revealed only modest translational repression and more significant mRNA destabilization. In Caenorhabditis elegans, the lin-4 miRNA accumulates during early larval development, binds to target elements in the lin-14 mRNA, and causes a sharp decrease in the abundance of LIN-14 protein. Here, we monitor the dynamics of lin-14 mRNA and protein as well as lin-4 miRNA levels in finely staged animals during early larval development. We find complex regulation of lin-14, with the abundance of lin-14 mRNA initially modestly declining followed by fluctuation but little further decline of lin-14 mRNA levels accompanied by continuing and more dramatic decline in LIN-14 protein abundance. We show that the translational inhibition of lin-14 is dependent on binding of the lin-4 miRNA to multiple lin-4 complementary sites in the lin-14 3'UTR. Our results point to the importance of translational inhibition in silencing of lin-14 by the lin-4 miRNA.

24059932	Title	Identification of an NF-KappaB p50/p65-responsive site in the human MIR155HG promoter.
24059932	Abstract	MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) is the diced product of the MIR155HG gene. miR-155 regulates the expression of many immune-specific transcripts, is overexpressed in many human lymphomas, and has oncogenic activity in mouse transgenic models. MIR155HG has been proposed to be a target gene for transcription factor NF-KappaB largely due to the positive correlation between high nuclear NF-KappaB activity and increased miR-155 expression following treatment with NF-KappaB inducers or in subsets of hematopoietic cancers. Nevertheless, direct regulation of the human MIR155HG promoter by NF-KappaB has not been convincingly demonstrated previously. This report shows that induction of NF-KappaB activity rapidly leads to increased levels of both primary MIR155HG mRNA and mature miR-155 transcripts. We have mapped an NF-KappaB-responsive element to a position approximately 178 nt upstream of the MIR155HG transcription start site. The -178 site is specifically bound by the NF-KappaB p50/p65 heterodimer and is required for p65-induced reporter gene activation. Moreover, the levels of miR-155 in nine human B-lymphoma cell lines generally correlate with increased nuclear NF-KappaB proteins. Overall, the identification of an NF-KappaB-responsive site in the MIR155HG proximal promoter suggests that MIR155HG is a direct NF-KappaB target gene in vivo. Understanding NF-KappaB-mediated regulation of miR-155 could lead to improved immune cell-related diagnostic tools and targeted therapies.

24062059	Title	Identification of microRNAs dysregulated in CD14 gene silencing RAW264.7 macrophage cells.
24062059	Abstract	A cluster of differentiation antigen 14 (CD14) is involved in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced proinflammatory cytokine release and LPS-induced septic shock. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that are involved in the epigenetic regulation of cellular process and bacterial infection. Our previous study indicated that siRNA against CD14 effectively inhibited LPS-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 2, interleukin-6 release, and NO production. To identify miRNAs which are affected by CD14 gene silencing and dissect the mechanisms of the attenuating of LPS-induced damaging immune activation more clearly, based on the CD14 knockdown RAW264.7 macrophage cell line established in our previous study, miRNAs expression profiling of CD14 knockdown RAW264.7 cells were analyzed with miRNA microarray and validated by qRT-PCR, the potential targets were predicted and subjected to gene ontology (GO) pathway and biological processes analysis. We demonstrated for the first time that CD14 knockdown significantly changed the expression of 199a-3p, miR-199a-5p, and miR-21-5p in RAW264.7 cells, and significantly enriched GO terms in the predicted target genes of these miRNAs were apoptosis process, immune response, inflammatory response, innate immune response, anti-apoptosis, cytokine production, and cytokine-mediated signaling pathway. These findings may improve our understanding about functional mechanism of miRNAs in the attenuating of LPS-induced damaging immune activation more clearly.

24063968	Title	A causal role for circulating miR-34b in osteosarcoma.
24063968	Abstract	To investigate the associations between plasma miR-34b/c expression levels and osteosarcoma (OS). A case-control study was conducted in 133 patients with OS and 133 controls. MiR-34b/c levels were detected by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays. Genotyping of SNP rs4938723 was done using the TaqMan assay. The causal association was examined by mendelian randomization analysis. Plasma miR-34b level was significantly lower in OS patients than in controls (P = 0.001). Expression levels of miR-34b in OS tissues decreased (P = 3.22 * 10(-4)) and was significantly related with its expression in plasma (r = 0.21, P = 0.004). Compared with wild-type TT genotype, the variant genotypes of rs4938723 TC/CC were significantly associated with increased OS risk (TC vs. TT: OR, 1.97 [95% CI: 1.40-2.55], P = 0.021; CC vs. TT: OR, 2.76 [95% CI: 2.00-3.53], P = 0.009; TC + CC vs. TT: OR, 2.16 [95% CI: 1.61-2.70], P = 0.006), consistent with its decreased effect on plasma miR-34b (TC vs. TT: -0.32 (-0.43, -0.21), P < 0.001; CC vs. TT: -0.70 (-0.84, -0.56), P < 0.001; TC + CC vs. TT: -0.42 (-0.53, -0.32), P < 0.001). Adjustment for miR-34b completely abolished the association between SNP rs4938723 and OS risk (P > 0.05). In addition, plasma expression levels of miR-34b were significantly decreased in the metastatic patients compared with that in the non-metastatic ones (P = 0.004). Plasma miR-34b was causally associated with OS risk and related with its metastatic status, suggesting that plasma miR-34b might be a novel biomarker and a potential treatment target for OS.

24064224	Title	miR-200b suppresses invasiveness and modulates the cytoskeletal and adhesive machinery in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells via targeting Kindlin-2.
24064224	Abstract	To further our understanding of the pathobiology of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), we previously performed microRNA profiling that revealed downregulation of miR-200b in ESCC. Using quantitative real-time PCR applied to 88 patient samples, we confirmed that ESCC tumors expressed significantly lower levels of miR-200b compared with the respective adjacent benign tissues (P = 0.003). Importantly, downregulation of miR-200b significantly correlated with shortened survival (P = 0.025), lymph node metastasis (P = 0.002) and advanced clinical stage (P = 0.020) in ESCC patients. Quantitative mass spectrometry identified 57 putative miR-200b targets, including Kindlin-2, previously implicated in the regulation of tumor invasiveness and actin cytoskeleton in other cell types. Enforced expression of miR-200b mimic in ESCC cells led to a decrease of Kindlin-2 expression, whereas transfection of miR-200b inhibitor induced Kindlin-2 expression. Furthermore, transfection of miR-200b mimic or knockdown of Kindlin-2 in ESCC cells decreased cell protrusion and focal adhesion (FA) formation, reduced cell spreading and invasiveness/migration. Enforced expression of Kindlin-2 largely abrogated the inhibitory effects of miR-200b on ESCC cell invasiveness. Mechanistic studies revealed that Rho-family guanosine triphosphatases and FA kinase mediated the biological effects of the miR-200b-Kindlin-2 axis in ESCC cells. To conclude, loss of miR-200b, a frequent biochemical defect in ESCC, correlates with aggressive clinical features. The tumor suppressor effects of miR-200b may be due to its suppression of Kindlin-2, a novel target of miR-200b that modulates actin cytoskeleton, FA formation and the migratory/invasiveness properties of ESCC.

24065179	Title	Genetic and epigenetic changes in a genomic region containing MIR172 in Arabidopsis allopolyploids and their progenitors.
24065179	Abstract	Combination of divergent genomes in allopolyploids creates genome-wide gene expression changes including many miRNA targets in Arabidopsis allotetraploids relative to the parents Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa. Here we report expression and epigenetic changes in a chromosomal region containing the MIR172b locus in the allotetraploids. Although mature miRNA sequences are conserved, A. thaliana and A. arenosa miRNA loci diverge rapidly in sequence and expression. Among four MIR172 loci in Arabidopsis, the level of nucleotide sequence divergence between A. thaliana and A. arenosa MIR172 loci is 15-25%, which is higher than that of protein-coding genes (∼5%). MIR172b locus and its flanking genes in A. arenosa were expressed at low levels relative to that in A. thaliana, which is associated with hypermethylation of this region in the allotetraploids. Consistently with this notion, pri-miR172 transcripts in the allotetraploids were primarily derived from the A. thaliana MIR172b locus. Expression of homoeologous alleles in miR172 target loci is associated with allelic loss, allelic changes in outcrossing A. arenosa or repression of A. thaliana alleles. These data suggest that gene expression changes in this homoeologous region are associated with genetic diversity and epigenetic variation of miRNA genes and their targets in allopolyploids.

24066118	Title	MicroRNA expression profile of mouse lung infected with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus.
24066118	Abstract	MicroRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression of various biological processes in a post-transcriptional manner under physiological and pathological conditions including host responses to viral infections. The 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus is an emerging reassortant strain of swine, human and bird influenza virus that can cause mild to severe illness and even death. To further understand the molecular pathogenesis of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus, we profiled cellular microRNAs of lungs from BALB/c mice infected with wild-type 2009 pandemic influenza virus A/Beijing/501/2009 (H1N1) (hereafter referred to as BJ501) and mouse-adapted influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1) (hereafter referred to as PR8) for comparison. Microarray analysis showed both the influenza virus BJ501 and PR8 infection induced strain- and temporal-specific microRNA expression patterns and that their infection caused a group of common and distinct differentially expressed microRNAs. Characteristically, more differentially expressed microRNAs were aroused on day 5 post infection than on day 2 and more up-regulated differentially expressed microRNAs were provoked than the down-regulated for both strains of influenza virus. Finally, 47 differentially expressed microRNAs were obtained for the infection of both strains of H1N1 influenza virus with 29 for influenza virus BJ501 and 43 for PR8. Among them, 15 microRNAs had no reported function, while 32 including miR-155 and miR-233 are known to play important roles in cancer, immunity and antiviral activity. Pathway enrichment analyses of the predicted targets revealed that the transforming growth factor-Beta (TGF-Beta) signaling pathway was the key cellular pathway associated with the differentially expressed miRNAs during influenza virus PR8 or BJ501 infection. To our knowledge, this is the first report of microRNA expression profiles of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus in a mouse model, and our findings might offer novel therapy targets for influenza virus infection. 

24068033	Title	Proteome modulation in H9c2 cardiac cells by microRNAs miR-378 and miR-378.
24068033	Abstract	MicroRNAs are a novel class of powerful endogenous regulators of gene expression. MiR-378 and miR-378* are localized in the first intron of the Ppargc1b gene that codes the transcriptional co-activator PGC-1Beta. The latter regulates energy expenditure as well as mitochondrial biogenesis. The miR-378:miR-378* hairpin is highly expressed in cardiac cells. To better assess their role in cardiomyocytes, we identified miR-378 and miR-378* targets via a proteomic screen. We established H9c2 cellular models of overexpression of miR-378 and miR-378* and identified a total of 86 down-regulated proteins in the presence of either one of these miRs. Functional annotation clustering showed that miR-378 and miR-378* regulate related pathways in cardiomyocytes, including energy metabolism, notably glycolysis, cytoskeleton, notably actin filaments and muscle contraction. Using bioinformatics algorithms we found that 20 proteins were predicted as direct targets of the miRs. We validated eight of these targets by quantitative RT-PCR and luciferase reporter assay. We found that miR-378 targets lactate dehydrogenase A and impacts on cell proliferation and survival whereas miR-378* targets cytoskeleton proteins actin and vimentin. Proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum stress response such as chaperone and/or calcium buffering proteins GRP78, PPIA (cyclophilin A), calumenin, and GMMPA involved in glycosylation are repressed by these miRs. Our results show that the miR-378/378* hairpin establishes a connection among energy metabolism, cytoskeleton remodeling, and endoplasmic reticulum function through post-transcriptional regulation of key proteins involved in theses pathways.

24068565	Title	miR-34a regulates cisplatin-induce gastric cancer cell death by modulating PI3K/AKT/survivin pathway.
24068565	Abstract	The purposes of this study were to determine the expression profiles of microRNA-34a (miR-34a) in human gastric cancer cell line (SGC-7901) and cisplatin-resistant cell lines (SGC-7901/DDP), and to establish the correlation between miR-34a expression profile and the sensitivity of human gastric cancer cell to cisplatin-based pattern, thereby providing new methods and strategies for treating gastric cancer. Gastric cancer cell line (SGC-7901) and cisplatin-resistant cell line (SGC-7901/DDP) were cultivated in vitro, respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blot were utilized to determine the expression profiles of miR-34a and survivin in both gastric cancer cell lines. With miR-34a mimic and miR-34a inhibitor transfected into SGC-7901 and SGC-7901/DDP for 48 h, post-transfection changes of miR-34a expression was determined; the effects of miR-34a ectopic expression on the viability of cisplatin-induce gastric cancer cell were assayed by the MTT method. The effects of miR-34a ectopic expression on apoptosis of cisplatin-induce gastric cancer cell were determined by Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) double staining method and flow cytometry. The effects of miR-34a ectopic expression on the AKT and p-AKT expression of cisplatin-induce gastric cancer cells were determined by Western blot and flow cytometry with the PI3K pathway inhibitor Wortmannin. As shown by qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses, the expression of miR-34a in cisplatin-resistant cell lines decreased significantly in comparison to that of SGC-7901 cell line (p < 0.05), while significant up-regulation of survivin expression was also observed (p < 0.05). Compared with the control group, the expression of miR-34a increased significantly in SGC-7901 cells transfected with miR-34a mimic for 48 h (p < 0.01). After miR-34a inhibitor transfection, the expression of miR-34a decreased significantly (p < 0.05). The viability of cisplatin-induce gastric cancer cells increased significantly (p < 0.05) with significant decrease of apoptosis after miR-34a expression inhibition, as demonstrated by MTT and flow cytometry with miR-34a over-expression, the viability of cisplatin-induce gastric cancer cells decreased significantly (p < 0.05), with significant apoptosis increase (p < 0.05). As shown by Western blot and flow cytometry, in comparison to the control group, Wortmannin could inhibit miR-34a inhibitor and DDP induced up-regulation of p-AKT significantly (p < 0.05) and stimulated apoptosis. In conclusion, miR-34a expression was down-regulated in cisplatin-resistant cell lines. miR-34a over-expression could improve the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells against cisplatin-based chemotherapies, with PI3K/AKT/survivin signaling pathway possibly involved in the mechanism.

24068568	Title	The tumor suppressor microRNA, miR-124a, is regulated by epigenetic silencing and by the transcriptional factor, REST in glioblastoma.
24068568	Abstract	Reduced levels of specific microRNA in cancer are frequently reported and associated with attenuated cancer genes and associated pathways. We previously reported a loss of miR-124a in glioblastoma (GBM) patient specimens; however, the upstream causes of this loss are largely unknown. Loss of miR-124a has been attributed to hypermethylation while other studies have shown miR-124a to be regulated by the repressor-element-1-silencing transcription factor (REST, also known as neuron-restrictive silencing factor). This current study looked at both epigenetic and transcription factor regulation as potential mechanisms resulting in the loss of miR-124a expression in GBM patient specimens and cell lines. Hypermethylation of miR-124a was observed in 82 % of GBM patient specimens (n = 56). In vitro miR-124a expression levels also increased after treatment of several patient-derived cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Additionally, we also demonstrated a positive interaction between REST activity and miR-124a using a luciferase-binding assay and we correlated the reciprocal expression of REST and miR-124a in our clinical cohort. This result indicates that miR-124a expression may also be modulated through the upstream targeting of REST. Preclinical studies involving inhibitors of REST and treatment with demethylating agents with the intent to increase miR-124a levels could be interesting.

24068957	Title	MicroRNA-17-92, a direct Ap-2Alpha transcriptional target, modulates T-box factor activity in orofacial clefting.
24068957	Abstract	Among the most common human congenital anomalies, cleft lip and palate (CL/P) affects up to 1 in 700 live births. MicroRNA (miR)s are small, non-coding RNAs that repress gene expression post-transcriptionally. The miR-17-92 cluster encodes six miRs that have been implicated in human cancers and heart development. We discovered that miR-17-92 mutant embryos had severe craniofacial phenotypes, including incompletely penetrant CL/P and mandibular hypoplasia. Embryos that were compound mutant for miR-17-92 and the related miR-106b-25 cluster had completely penetrant CL/P. Expression of Tbx1 and Tbx3, the DiGeorge/velo-cardio-facial (DGS) and Ulnar-mammary syndrome (UMS) disease genes, was expanded in miR-17-92 mutant craniofacial structures. Both Tbx1 and Tbx3 had functional miR seed sequences that mediated gene repression. Analysis of miR-17-92 regulatory regions uncovered conserved and functional AP-2Alpha recognition elements that directed miR-17-92 expression. Together, our data indicate that miR-17-92 modulates expression of critical T-box transcriptional regulators during midface development and is itself a target of Bmp-signaling and the craniofacial pioneer factor AP-2Alpha. Our data are the first genetic evidence that an individual miR or miR cluster is functionally important in mammalian CL/P.

24068960	Title	miR-1/133a clusters cooperatively specify the cardiomyogenic lineage by adjustment of myocardin levels during embryonic heart development.
24068960	Abstract	miRNAs are small RNAs directing many developmental processes by posttranscriptional regulation of protein-coding genes. We uncovered a new role for miR-1-1/133a-2 and miR-1-2/133a-1 clusters in the specification of embryonic cardiomyocytes allowing transition from an immature state characterized by expression of smooth muscle (SM) genes to a more mature fetal phenotype. Concomitant knockout of miR-1-1/133a-2 and miR-1-2/133a-1 released suppression of the transcriptional co-activator myocardin, a major regulator of SM gene expression, but not of its binding partner SRF. Overexpression of myocardin in the embryonic heart essentially recapitulated the miR-1/133a mutant phenotype at the molecular level, arresting embryonic cardiomyocytes in an immature state. Interestingly, the majority of postulated miR-1/133a targets was not altered in double mutant mice, indicating that the ability of miR-1/133a to suppress target molecules strongly depends on the cellular context. Finally, we show that myocardin positively regulates expression of miR-1/133a, thus constituting a negative feedback loop that is essential for early cardiac development.

24068984	Title	Plasmid-based target protectors allow specific blockade of miRNA silencing activity in mammalian developmental systems.
24068984	Abstract	Over the past decade, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as essential posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression. Though a great deal has been discovered about miRNA genomics, biogenesis, mechanisms, and functions, the challenge of attributing phenotypes of altered miRNA expression to specific targets still remains. Here, we apply the existing target protector concept of blocking miRNA action at a single binding site in the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of its target to a plasmid-based approach. We optimize and demonstrate target protector efficacy in vitro, where it blocks repression of a luciferase construct and an endogenous protein. Using the developing mouse cortex as a model, we validate that target protectors are effective in vivo, where protectors for the miR-19a binding sites in the Pten 3'UTR alter proliferation and specification of neural progenitors, phenocopying Pten ectopic expression phenotypes. Our study introduces a new tool for analyzing specific miRNA:target interactions across mammalian developmental systems, facilitating further miRNA functional discoveries.

24069256	Title	Anti-tumor activity of a miR-199-dependent oncolytic adenovirus.
24069256	Abstract	The down-regulation of miR-199 occurs in nearly all primary hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and HCC cell lines in comparison with normal liver. We exploited this miR-199 differential expression to develop a conditionally replication-competent oncolytic adenovirus, Ad-199T, and achieve tumor-specific viral expression and replication. To this aim, we introduced four copies of miR-199 target sites within the 3' UTR of E1A gene, essential for viral replication. As consequence, E1A expression from Ad-199T virus was tightly regulated both at RNA and protein levels in HCC derived cell lines, and replication controlled by the level of miR-199 expression. Various approaches were used to asses in vivo properties of Ad-199T. Ad-199T replication was inhibited in normal, miR-199 positive, liver parenchyma, thus resulting in reduced hepatotoxicity. Conversely, the intrahepatic delivery of Ad-199T in newborn mice led to virus replication and fast removal of implanted HepG2 liver cancer cells. The ability of Ad-199T to control tumor growth was also shown in a subcutaneous xenograft model in nude mice and in HCCs arising in immune-competent mice. In summary, we developed a novel oncolytic adenovirus, Ad-199T, which could demonstrate a therapeutic potential against liver cancer without causing significant hepatotoxicity.

24071644	Title	USP2a alters chemotherapeutic response by modulating redox.
24071644	Abstract	Cancer cells are characterized by altered ubiquitination of many proteins. The ubiquitin-specific protease 2a (USP2a) is a deubiquitinating enzyme overexpressed in prostate adenocarcinomas, where it exhibits oncogenic behavior in a variety of ways including targeting c-Myc via the miR-34b/c cluster. Here we demonstrate that USP2a induces drug resistance in both immortalized and transformed prostate cells. Specifically, it confers resistance to typically pro-oxidant agents, such as cisplatin (CDDP) and doxorubicin (Doxo), and to taxanes. USP2a overexpression protects from drug-induced oxidative stress by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and stabilizing the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaΨ), thus impairing downstream p38 activation and triggering of apoptosis. The molecular mediator of the USP2a protective function is the glutathione (GSH). Through miR-34b/c-driven c-Myc regulation, USP2a increases intracellular GSH content, thus interfering with the oxidative cascade triggered by chemotherapeutic agents. In light of these findings, targeting Myc and/or miR-34b/c might revert chemo-resistance.

24076586	Title	The role, mechanism and potentially therapeutic application of microRNA-29 family in acute myeloid leukemia.
24076586	Abstract	Abnormal proliferation, apoptosis repression and differentiation blockage of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells have been characterized to be the main reasons leading to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Previous studies showed that miR-29a and miR-29b could function as tumor suppressors in leukemogenesis. However, a comprehensive investigation of the function and mechanism of miR-29 family in AML development and their potentiality in AML therapy still need to be elucidated. Herein, we reported that the family members, miR-29a, -29b and -29c, were commonly downregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow (BM) CD34+ cells derived from AML patients as compared with the healthy donors. Overexpression of each miR-29 member in THP1 and NB4 cells markedly inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis. AKT2 and CCND2 mRNAs were demonstrated to be targets of the miR-29 members, and the role of miR-29 family was attributed to the decrease of Akt2 and CCND2, two key signaling molecules. Significantly increased Akt2, CCND2 and c-Myc levels in the AML cases were detected, which were correlated with the decreased miR-29 expression in AML blasts. Furthermore, a feed-back loop comprising of c-Myc, miR-29 family and Akt2 were found in myeloid leukemogenesis. Reintroduction of each miR-29 member partially corrected abnormal cell proliferation and apoptosis repression and myeloid differentiation arrest in AML BM blasts. An intravenous injection of miR-29a, -29b and -29c in the AML model mice relieved leukemic symptoms significantly. Taken together, our finding revealed a pivotal role of miR-29 family in AML development and rescue of miR-29 family expression in AML patients could provide a new therapeutic strategy.

24076654	Title	microRNA-17-92 cluster is a direct Nanog target and controls neural stem cell through Trp53inp1.
24076654	Abstract	The transcription factor Nanog plays a critical role in the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells as well as in neural stem cells (NSCs). microRNAs (miRNAs) are also involved in stemness regulation. However, the miRNA network downstream of Nanog is still poorly understood. High-throughput screening of miRNA expression profiles in response to modulated levels of Nanog in postnatal NSCs identifies miR-17-92 cluster as a direct target of Nanog. Nanog controls miR-17-92 cluster by binding to the upstream regulatory region and maintaining high levels of transcription in NSCs, whereas Nanog/promoter association and cluster miRNAs expression are lost alongside differentiation. The two miR-17 family members of miR-17-92 cluster, namely miR-17 and miR-20a, target Trp53inp1, a downstream component of p53 pathway. To support a functional role, the presence of miR-17/20a or the loss of Trp53inp1 is required for the Nanog-induced enhancement of self-renewal of NSCs. We unveil an arm of the Nanog/p53 pathway, which regulates stemness in postnatal NSCs, wherein Nanog counteracts p53 signals through miR-17/20a-mediated repression of Trp53inp1.

24078004	Title	MiR-25 promotes gastric cancer cells growth and motility by targeting RECK.
24078004	Abstract	Gastric cancer (GC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Recently, accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) play prominent roles in tumorigenesis and metastasis. Here, we confirmed that miR-25 was significantly increased in human GC tissues and cell lines. Forced expression of miR-25 remarkably enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in GC cells, whereas inhibition of miR-25 by inhibitor caused significant suppression of proliferation and significant increase of apoptosis. Moreover, inhibition of miR-25 significantly decreased migration and invasion of GC cells. Finally, reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK) was found to be a target of miR-25. Overexpression of RECK could significantly reverse the oncogenic effect of miR-25. Taken together, miR-25 might promote GC cells growth and motility partially by targeting RECK.

24078287	Title	Regulation of cytochrome b5 expression by miR-223 in human liver: effects on cytochrome P450 activities.
24078287	Abstract	Cytochrome b5 (b5) is a hemoprotein that transfers electrons to several enzymes to fulfill functions in fatty acid desaturation, methemoglobin reduction, steroidogenesis, and drug metabolism. Despite the importance of b5, the regulation of b5 expression in human liver remains largely unknown. We investigated whether microRNA (miRNA) might be involved in the regulation of human b5. Twenty-four human liver specimens were used for correlation analysis. In silico analysis and luciferase assay were performed to determine whether the predicted miRNAs functionally target to b5. The miR-223 was overexpressed into HepG2 cells infected with adenovirus expressing human cytochrome P450. In human livers, the b5 protein levels were not positively correlated with the b5 mRNA levels, and miR-223 levels were inversely correlated with the b5 mRNA levels or the translational efficiencies. The luciferase assay showed that miR-223 functionally binds to the element in the 3′-untranslated region of b5 mRNA. The overexpression of miR-223 significantly reduced the endogenous b5 protein level and the mRNA stability in HepG2 cells. Moreover, the overexpression of miR-223 significantly reduced CYP3A4-catalyzed testosterone 6β-hydroxylation activity and CYP2E1-catalyzed chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylase activity but not CYP1A2-catalyzed 7-ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase activity. miR-223 down-regulates b5 expression in the human liver, modulating P450 activities.

24083596	Title	MicroRNA-302b suppresses cell proliferation by targeting EGFR in human hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells.
24083596	Abstract	MicroRNAs are regulators that can play an essential role in tumorigenesis. Although miR-302 families have been suggested to be tumor repressors in human cancer, the mechanism by which they suppress tumor development remains to be defined. In this study, we discover that miR302b suppresses tumor proliferation may due to directly targeting EGFR in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). QRT-PCR was used to assess miR-302b and EGFR expression in 27 pairs of clinical hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and their corresponding adjacent nontumorous liver tissues. MTT, colony formation, immunofluorescence staining, and cell cycle assays were used to examine the tumor suppressor role of miR302b in cell proliferation. Luciferase assays were performed to assess the EGFR was a novel target of miR-302b. Western blot assay was used to validate the protein expression level. We demonstrated that miR-302b was frequently down-regulated, whereas EGFR was up-regulated in 27 pairs of clinical HCC and non-tumorous counterparts. The dual-luciferase reporter assays revealed that EGFR was a novel target of miR-302b. Re-expression of miR-302b resulted in the inhibition of proliferation in hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells. The silencing of EGFR by miR-302b or siEGFR led to down-regulation of proliferation-related proteins, such as AKT2, CCND1, and CDK2. miR-302b suppresses HCC growth may due to targeting the EGFR/AKT2/CCND1 pathway.

24084574	Title	Identification of potential microRNA-target pairs associated with osteopetrosis by deep sequencing, iTRAQ proteomics and bioinformatics.
24084574	Abstract	MicroRNAs aberrantly express in many human diseases including some metabolic bone disorders. They have been found to be associated with osteoclast differentiation and function, which makes them attractive candidates for the therapy of bone. However, the potential clinical application of microRNAs in therapeutics rests heavily upon our in-depth understanding of microRNAs and their targets. To identify potential microRNA-target pairs associated with osteopetrosis, we performed a system approach including deep sequencing, iTRAQ quantitative proteomics, and bioinformatics in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) taken from patients with osteopetrosis and health donors. Notably, 123 differently expressed microRNAs, 173 differently expressed proteins, and 117 computationally predicted microRNA-target pairs with reciprocally expressed level in PBMCs were found in the two sample groups. Functional annotation identified that the microRNA-target pairs were involved in cell growth, differentiation, cellular signaling network, and the network highlighted the microRNA-target pair of has-miR-320a and ADP ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) potentially associated with CLCN7 mutations in osteopetrosis. The pair of has-miR-320a and Arf1 was further verified by real-time PCR, western blot, and the interaction between has-miR-320a and its targeted sequence on the Arf1 mRNAs was confirmed by luciferase assay. Collectively, the present study established a new system approach for the investigation of microRNAs, and the microRNA-target pairs, particular has-miR-320a and Arf1, may have important roles in osteopetrosis.

24084690	Title	Systemic delivery of microRNA-181b inhibits nuclear factor-κB activation, vascular inflammation, and atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.
24084690	Abstract	Activated nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling in the vascular endothelium promotes the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Targeting endothelial NF-κB may provide a novel strategy to limit chronic inflammation. To examine the role of microRNA-181b (miR-181b) in endothelial NF-κB signaling and effects on atherosclerosis. MiR-181b expression was reduced in the aortic intima and plasma in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet. Correspondingly, circulating miR-181b in the plasma was markedly reduced in human subjects with coronary artery disease. Systemic delivery of miR-181b resulted in a 2.3-fold overexpression of miR-181b in the aortic intima of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice and suppressed NF-κB signaling revealed by bioluminescence imaging and reduced target gene expression in the aortic arch in apolipoprotein E-deficient/NF-κB-luciferase transgenic mice. MiR-181b significantly inhibited atherosclerotic lesion formation, proinflammatory gene expression and the influx of lesional macrophages and CD4+ T cells in the vessel wall. Mechanistically, miR-181b inhibited the expression of the target gene importin-α3, an effect that reduced NF-κB nuclear translocation specifically in the vascular endothelium of lesions, whereas surprisingly leukocyte NF-κB signaling was unaffected despite a 7-fold overexpression of miR-181b. Our findings uncover that NF-κB nuclear translocation in leukocytes does not involve importin-α3, but rather importin-α5, which miR-181b does not target, highlighting that inhibition of NF-κB signaling in the endothelium is sufficient to mediate miR-181b's protective effects. Systemic delivery of miR-181b inhibits the activation of NF-κB and atherosclerosis through cell-specific mechanisms in the vascular endothelium. These findings support the rationale that delivery of miR-181b may provide a novel therapeutic approach to treat chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis.

24085799	Title	miR-720 inhibits tumor invasion and migration in breast cancer by targeting TWIST1.
24085799	Abstract	Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among females, with tumor metastasis being primarily responsible for breast cancer-associated mortality. Current literatures have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are implicated in tumor metastasis. In this study, we found that the expression of miR-720 was significantly downregulated in primary breast cancer, with greater downregulation in metastatic tumors. Statistical analysis of 105 cases of primary human breast cancer demonstrated that decreased expression of miR-720 was correlated with lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, reexpression of miR-720 in breast cancer cells remarkably inhibited cell invasiveness and migration both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, downregulation of TWIST1, a promoter of metastasis that was identified as a direct functional target of miR-720, was attributed to the inhibition of metastasis. Consistent with the reduced TWIST1 levels in breast cancer, reexpression of miR-720 upregulated epithelial markers (E-cadherin and β-catenin) and downregulated mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin, fibronectin, vimentin and matrix metalloproteinase-2). Expression of miR-720 was inversely associated with TWIST1 in human breast cancer tissues. Knockdown of TWIST1 expression by small interfering RNA exhibited similar effects to reintroduction of miR-720, whereas overexpression of TWIST1 (without the 3'-untranslated region) abrogated miR-720-mediated metastasis inhibition. Collectively, our data indicate that miR-720 is frequently decreased in breast cancer and manifests antimetastatic activity by downregulating TWIST1, presenting a novel mechanism of miRNA-mediated regulation of tumor metastasis.

24086481	Title	MiR-27a regulates apoptosis in nucleus pulposus cells by targeting PI3K.
24086481	Abstract	The precise role of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) remains to be elucidated. We analyzed degenerative nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and found that the expression of miR-27a was increased. The overexpression of miR-27a was further verified using real-time RT-PCR. Bioinformatics target prediction identified phosphoinositide-3 kinases (PI3K) as putative targets of miR-27a. Furthermore, miR-27a inhibited PI3K expression by directly targeting their 3'-UTRs, and this inhibition was abolished by mutation of the miR-27a binding sites. Various cellular processes including cell growth, proliferation, migration and adhesion are regulated by activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, and nucleus pulposus cells are known to strongly express the phosphorylated survival protein AKT. Our results identify PI3K as a novel target of miR-27a. Upregulation of miR-27a thus targets PI3K, initiating apoptosis of nucleus pulposus cells. This present study revealed that downregulated miR-27a might develop a novel intervention for IDD treatment through the prevention of apoptosis in Nucleus pulposus Cells.

24086639	Title	MicroRNA-150 expression induces myeloid differentiation of human acute leukemia cells and normal hematopoietic progenitors.
24086639	Abstract	In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and blast crisis (BC) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) normal differentiation is impaired. Differentiation of immature stem/progenitor cells is critical for normal blood cell function. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are small non-coding RNAs that interfere with gene expression by degrading messenger RNAs (mRNAs) or blocking protein translation. Aberrant miRNA expression is a feature of leukemia and miRNAs also play a significant role in normal hematopoiesis and differentiation. We have identified miRNAs differentially expressed in AML and BC CML and identified a new role for miR-150 in myeloid differentiation. Expression of miR-150 is low or absent in BC CML and AML patient samples and cell lines. We have found that expression of miR-150 in AML cell lines, CD34+ progenitor cells from healthy individuals, and primary BC CML and AML patient samples at levels similar to miR-150 expression in normal bone marrow promotes myeloid differentiation of these cells. MYB is a direct target of miR-150, and we have identified that the observed phenotype is partially mediated by MYB. In AML cell lines, differentiation of miR-150 expressing cells occurs independently of retinoic acid receptor α (RARA) signaling. High-throughput gene expression profiling (GEP) studies of the AML cell lines HL60, PL21, and THP-1 suggest that activation of CEPBA, CEBPE, and cytokines associated with myeloid differentiation in miR-150 expressing cells as compared to control cells contributes to myeloid differentiation. These data suggest that miR-150 promotes myeloid differentiation, a previously uncharacterized role for this miRNA, and that absent or low miR-150 expression contributes to blocked myeloid differentiation in acute leukemia cells.

24086656	Title	microRNA-22 promotes heart failure through coordinate suppression of PPAR/ERR-nuclear hormone receptor transcription.
24086656	Abstract	Increasing evidence suggests that microRNAs are intimately involved in the pathophysiology of heart failure. MicroRNA-22 (miR-22) is a muscle-enriched miRNA required for optimum cardiac gene transcription and adaptation to hemodynamic stress by pressure overload in mice. Recent evidence also suggests that miR-22 induces hypertrophic growth and it is oftentimes upregulated in end stage heart failure. However the scope of mRNA targets and networks of miR-22 in the heart failure remained unclear. We analyzed transgenic mice with enhanced levels of miR-22 expression in adult cardiomyocytes to identify important pathophysiologic targets of miR-22. Our data shows that forced expression of miR-22 induces a pro-hypertrophic gene expression program, and it elicits contractile dysfunction leading to cardiac dilation and heart failure. Increased expression of miR-22 impairs the Ca(2+) transient, Ca(2+) loading into the sarcoplasmic reticulum plus it interferes with transcription of estrogen related receptor (ERR) and PPAR downstream genes. Mechanistically, miR-22 postranscriptionally inhibits peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α), PPARα and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) expression via a synergistic circuit, which may account for deleterious actions of unchecked miR-22 expression on the heart.

24091133	Title	A signal-amplification circuit between miR-218 and Wnt/β-catenin signal promotes human adipose tissue-derived stem cells osteogenic differentiation.
24091133	Abstract	Human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) have become a highly attractive source of seed cells in bone regenerative. It has become a key issue how to effectively improve osteogenic differentiation of hASCs in the bone tissue engineering. Numerous regulatory pathways dominate osteogenic differentiation of hASCs involve transcriptional factors and signaling molecules. However, how these factors combine with each other to regulate hASCs osteogenic differentiation still remain to be illustrated. The identification of microRNAs will illuminate this and might permit finely tuning the osteogenic differentiation process. Here, we present evidence that miR-218 acts as a positive regulator of hASCs osteogenesis. Real-time PCR shows that miR-218 was up-regulated during osteogenic differentiation. Overexpression of exogenous miR-218 enhanced osteogenic differentiation in vitro, whereas inhibition of miR-218 would suppress osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, miR-218 directly targeted SFRP2 and DKK2, which is a WNT signaling pathway antagonist, and enhanced Wnt/β-catenin signaling activity. Finally, we found that mimicking Wnt/β-catenin signal strengthened the expression level of miR-218, while blocking the signal attenuated the expression level of miR-218. This feed-forward regulatory circuit provides additional insight into how miRNAs acting as a signal amplifier interact with signal molecules during hASCs osteogenic differentiation. Taken together, we have established a regulatory network with a central role for the miR-218 in hASCs osteogenic differentiation.

24091622	Title	Tumour-suppressive microRNA-29s inhibit cancer cell migration and invasion by targeting laminin-integrin signalling in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
24091622	Abstract	Our recent studies of microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures demonstrated that microRNA-29s (miR-29s; miR-29a/b/c) were significantly downregulated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and were putative tumour-suppressive miRNAs in human cancers. Our aim in this study was to investigate the functional significance of miR-29s in cancer cells and to identify novel miR-29s-mediated cancer pathways and responsible genes in HNSCC oncogenesis and metastasis. Gain-of-function studies using mature miR-29s were performed to investigate cell proliferation, migration and invasion in two HNSCC cell lines (SAS and FaDu). To identify miR-29s-mediated molecular pathways and targets, we utilised gene expression analysis and in silico database analysis. Loss-of-function assays were performed to investigate the functional significance of miR-29s target genes. Restoration of miR-29s in SAS and FaDu cell lines revealed significant inhibition of cancer cell migration and invasion. Gene expression data and in silico analysis demonstrated that miR-29s modulated the focal adhesion pathway. Moreover, laminin γ2 (LAMC2) and α6 integrin (ITGA6) genes were candidate targets of the regulation of miR-29s. Luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-29s directly regulated LAMC2 and ITGA6. Silencing of LAMC2 and ITGA6 genes significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in cancer cells. Downregulation of miR-29s was a frequent event in HNSCC. The miR-29s acted as tumour suppressors and directly targeted laminin-integrin signalling. Recognition of tumour-suppressive miRNA-mediated cancer pathways provides new insights into the potential mechanisms of HNSCC oncogenesis and metastasis and suggests novel therapeutic strategies for the disease.

24096486	Title	microRNA-10b enhances pancreatic cancer cell invasion by suppressing TIP30 expression and promoting EGF and TGF-β actions.
24096486	Abstract	Increased microRNA-10b (miR-10b) expression in the cancer cells in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a marker of disease aggressiveness. In the present study, we determined that plasma miR-10b levels are significantly increased in PDAC patients by comparison with normal controls. By gene profiling, we identified potential targets downregulated by miR-10b, including Tat-interacting protein 30 (TIP30). Immunoblotting and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that TIP30 was a direct miR-10b target. Downregulation of TIP30 by miR-10b or siRNA-mediated silencing of TIP30 enhanced epidermal growth factor (EGF)-dependent invasion. The actions of miR-10b were abrogated by expressing a modified TIP30 cDNA resistant to miR-10b. EGF-induced EGF receptor (EGFR) tyrosine phosphorylation and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation were enhanced by miR-10b, and these effects were mimicked by TIP30 silencing. The actions of EGF in the presence of miR-10b were blocked by EGFR kinase inhibition with erlotinib and by dual inhibition of PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase) and MEK. Moreover, miR-10b, EGF and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) combined to markedly increase cell invasion, and this effect was blocked by the combination of erlotinib and SB505124, a type I TGF-β receptor inhibitor. miR-10b also enhanced the stimulatory effects of EGF and TGF-β on cell migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and decreased the expression of RAP2A, EPHB2, KLF4 and NF1. Moreover, miR-10b overexpression accelerated pancreatic cancer cell (PCC) proliferation and tumor growth in an orthotopic model. Thus, plasma miR-10b levels may serve as a diagnostic marker in PDAC, whereas intra-tumoral miR-10b promotes PCC proliferation and invasion by suppressing TIP30, which enhances EGFR signaling, facilitates EGF-TGF-β cross-talk and enhances the expression of EMT-promoting genes, whereas decreasing the expression of several metastasis-suppressing genes. Therefore, therapeutic targeting of miR-10b in PDAC may interrupt growth-promoting deleterious EGF-TGF-β interactions and antagonize the metastatic process at various levels.

24097871	Title	Contrasting expression patterns of histone mRNA and microRNA 760 in patients with gastric cancer.
24097871	Abstract	Recent studies revealed that both disseminated tumor cells and noncancerous cells contributed to cancer progression cooperatively in the bone marrow. Here, RNA-seq analysis of bone marrow from gastric cancer patients was performed to identify prognostic markers for gastric cancer. Bone marrow samples from eight gastric cancer patients (stages I and IV: n = 4 each) were used for RNA-seq analysis. Results were validated through quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of HIST1H3D expression in 175 bone marrow, 92 peripheral blood, and 115 primary tumor samples from gastric cancer patients. miR-760 expression was assayed using qRT-PCR in 105 bone marrow and 96 primary tumor samples. Luciferase reporter assays were performed to confirm whether histone mRNAs were direct targets of miR-760. miR-760 expression was also evaluated in noncancerous cells from gastric cancer patients. RNA-seq analysis of bone marrow samples from gastric cancer patients revealed higher expression of multiple histone mRNAs in stage IV patients. HIST1H3D expression in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, and primary tumor of stage IV patients was higher than that in stage I patients (P = 0.0284, 0.0243, and 0.0006, respectively). In contrast, miR-760 was downregulated in the bone marrow and primary tumor of stage IV patients compared with stage I patients (P = 0.0094 and 0.0018, respectively). Histone mRNA and miR-760 interacted directly. Furthermore, miR-760 was downregulated in noncancerous mucosa in stage IV gastric cancer patients. Histone mRNA was upregulated, whereas miR-760 was downregulated in the bone marrow and primary tumor of advanced gastric cancer patients, suggesting that the histone mRNA/miR-760 axis had a crucial role in the development of gastric cancer.

24098322	Title	MiRNA-181a regulates adipogenesis by targeting tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in the porcine model.
24098322	Abstract	Adipogenesis is tightly regulated by altering gene expression, and TNF-α is a multifunctional cytokine that plays an important role in regulating lipogenesis. MicroRNAs are strong post-transcriptional regulators of cell differentiation. In our previous work, we found high expression of miR-181a in a fat-rich pig breed. Using bioinformatic analysis, miR-181a was identified as a potential regulator of TNF-α. Here, we validated TNF-α as the target of miR-181a by a dual luciferase assay. In response to adipogenesis, a mimic or inhibitor was used to overexpress or reduce miR-181a expression in porcine pre-adipocytes, which were then induced into mature adipocytes. Overexpression of miR-181a accelerated accumulation of lipid droplets, increased the amount of triglycerides, and repressed TNF-α protein expression, while the inhibitor had the opposite effect. At the same time, TNF-alpha rescued the increased lipogenesis by miR181a mimics. Additionally, miR-181a suppression decreased the expression of fatty synthesis associated genes PDE3B (phosphodiesterase 3B), LPL (lipoprotein lipase), PPARγ (proliferator-activated receptor-γ), GLUT1 (glucose transporter), GLUT4, adiponectin and FASN (fatty acid synthase), as well as key lipolytic genes HSL (hormone-sensitive lipase) and ATGL (adipose triglyceride lipase) as revealed by quantitative real-time PCR. Our study provides the first evidence of the role of miR-181a in adipocyte differentiation by regulation of TNF-α, which may became a new therapeutic target for anti-obesity drugs.

24098361	Title	Perfluorooctane sulfonate disturbs Nanog expression through miR-490-3p in mouse embryonic stem cells.
24098361	Abstract	Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) poses potential risks to reproduction and development. Mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) are ideal models for developmental toxicity testing of environmental contaminants in vitro. However, the mechanism by which PFOS affects early embryonic development is still unclear. In this study, mESCs were exposed to PFOS for 24 h, and then general cytotoxicity and pluripotency were evaluated. MTT assay showed that neither PFOS (0.2 µM, 2 µM, 20 µM, and 200 µM) nor control medium (0.1% DMSO) treatments affected cell viability. Furthermore, there were no significant differences in cell cycle and apoptosis between the PFOS treatment and control groups. However, we found that the mRNA and protein levels of pluripotency markers (Sox2, Nanog) in mESCs were significantly decreased following exposure to PFOS for 24 h, while there were no significant changes in the mRNA and protein levels of Oct4. Accordingly, the expression levels of miR-145 and miR-490-3p, which can regulate Sox2 and Nanog expressions were significantly increased. Chrm2, the host gene of miR-490-3p, was positively associated with miR-490-3p expression after PFOS exposure. Dual luciferase reporter assay suggests that miR-490-3p directly targets Nanog. These results suggest that PFOS can disturb the expression of pluripotency factors in mESCs, while miR-145 and miR-490-3p play key roles in modulating this effect.

24098452	Title	miR-125b acts as a tumor suppressor in breast tumorigenesis via its novel direct targets ENPEP, CK2-α, CCNJ, and MEGF9.
24098452	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in diverse biological processes and are emerging as key regulators of tumorigenesis and tumor progression. To explore the dysregulation of miRNAs in breast cancer, a genome-wide expression profiling of 939 miRNAs was performed in 50 breast cancer patients. A total of 35 miRNAs were aberrantly expressed between breast cancer tissue and adjacent normal breast tissue and several novel miRNAs were identified as potential oncogenes or tumor suppressor miRNAs in breast tumorigenesis. miR-125b exhibited the largest decrease in expression. Enforced miR-125b expression in mammary cells decreased cell proliferation by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest and reduced anchorage-independent cell growth of cells of mammary origin. miR-125b was found to perform its tumor suppressor function via the direct targeting of the 3'-UTRs of ENPEP, CK2-α, CCNJ, and MEGF9 mRNAs. Silencing these miR-125b targets mimicked the biological effects of miR-125b overexpression, confirming that they are modulated by miR-125b. Analysis of ENPEP, CK2-α, CCNJ, and MEGF9 protein expression in breast cancer patients revealed that they were overexpressed in 56%, 40-56%, 20%, and 32% of the tumors, respectively. The expression of ENPEP and CK2-α was inversely correlated with miR-125b expression in breast tumors, indicating the relevance of these potential oncogenic proteins in breast cancer patients. Our results support a prognostic role for CK2-α, whose expression may help clinicians predict breast tumor aggressiveness. In particular, our results show that restoration of miR-125b expression or knockdown of ENPEP, CK2-α, CCNJ, or MEGF9 may provide novel approaches for the treatment of breast cancer.

24098490	Title	Tumor suppressive function of mir-205 in breast cancer is linked to HMGB3 regulation.
24098490	Abstract	Identifying targets of dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) will enhance our understanding of how altered miRNA expression contributes to the malignant phenotype of breast cancer. The expression of miR-205 was reduced in four breast cancer cell lines compared to the normal-like epithelial cell line MCF10A and in tumor and metastatic tissues compared to adjacent benign breast tissue. Two predicted binding sites for miR-205 were identified in the 3' untranslated region of the high mobility group box 3 gene, HMGB3. Both dual-luciferase reporter assay and Western blotting confirmed that miR-205 binds to and regulates HMGB3. To further explore miR-205 targeting of HMGB3, WST-1 proliferation and in vitro invasion assays were performed in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells transiently transfected with precursor miR-205 oligonucleotide or HMGB3 small interfering RNA (siRNA). Both treatments reduced the proliferation and invasion of the cancer cells. The mRNA and protein levels of HMGB3 were higher in the tumor compared to adjacent benign specimens and there was an indirect correlation between the expression of HMGB3 mRNA and patient survival. Treatment of breast cancer cells with 5-Aza/TSA derepressed miR-205 and reduced HMGB3 mRNA while knockdown of the transcriptional repressor NRSF/REST, reduced miR-205 and increased HMGB3. In conclusion, regulation of HMGB3 by miR-205 reduced both proliferation and invasion of breast cancer cells. Our findings suggest that modulating miR-205 and/or targeting HMGB3 are potential therapies for advanced breast cancer.

24098708	Abstract	Methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) is the cellular enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the principal biological methyl donor and a key regulator of hepatocyte proliferation, death and differentiation. Two genes, MAT1A and MAT2A, encode 2 distinct catalytic MAT isoforms. A third gene, MAT2B, encodes a MAT2A regulatory subunit. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), MAT1A downregulation and MAT2A upregulation occur, known as the MAT1A:MAT2A switch. The switch is accompanied with an increasing expression of MAT2B, which results in decreased SAM levels and facilitates cancer cell growth. Berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid isolated from many medicinal herbs such as Coptis chinensis, has a wide range of pharmacological effects including anti-cancer effects. Because drug-induced microRNAs have recently emerged as key regulators in guiding their pharmacological effects, we examined whether microRNA expression is differentially altered by berberine treatment in HCC. In this study, we used microRNA microarrays to find that the expression level of miR-21-3p (previously named miR-21*) increased after berberine treatment in the HepG2 human hepatoma cell line. To predict the putative targets of miR-21-3p, we integrated the gene expression profiles of HepG2 cells after berberine treatment by comparing with a gene list generated from sequence-based microRNA target prediction software. We then confirmed these predictions through transfection of microRNA mimics and a 3' UTR reporter assay. Our findings provide the first evidence that miR-21-3p directly reduces the expression of MAT2A and MAT2B by targeting their 3' UTRs. In addition, an overexpression of miR-21-3p increased intracellular SAM contents, which have been proven to be a growth disadvantage for hepatoma cells. The overexpression of miR-21-3p suppresses growth and induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Overall, our results demonstrate that miR-21-3p functions as a tumor suppressor by directly targeting both MAT2A and MAT2B, indicating its therapeutic potential in HCC.

24099915	Title	MicroRNA-31 inhibits cisplatin-induced apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer cells by regulating the drug transporter ABCB9.
24099915	Abstract	Alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expression have been found to be involved in tumor growth and response to chemotherapy. However, the possible role of miR-31 in cisplatin (DDP) resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. In this study, we identified a DDP-sensitive and a DDP-resistant cell line from four candidate human NSCLC cell lines. Notably, we found that miR-31 was significantly upregulated in the DDP-resistant cell line compared with its level in the DDP-sensitive cell line. As a result, miR-31 overexpression induced DDP resistance in the DDP-sensitive cell line, and miR-31 knockdown rescued DDP sensitivity in the DDP-resistant cell line. Interestingly, miR-31 was inversely correlated with the expression of the drug resistance gene ABCB9. The luciferase activity assay showed that miR-31 directly targets the 3'UTR of ABCB9, which is known to play a crucial role in drug resistance. Mechanistically, we showed that miR-31 confers DDP-induced apoptosis and that inhibition of ABCB9 is required for DDP resistance. The data demonstrate that miR-31 exerts an anti-apoptotic effect most likely through the inhibition of ABCB9 and thus provide a novel strategy involving the use of miR-31 as a potential target in NSCLC chemotherapy.

24100264	Title	Profibrotic effect of miR-33a with Akt activation in hepatic stellate cells.
24100264	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) attract more attention in the pathophysiology of liver fibrosis and miR-33a has been previously demonstrated as involved in the regulation of cholesterol and lipid metabolism. Transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-β1) is generally accepted to be the main stimulating factor in the hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation, which plays an important role in hepatic fibrosis. However, the involvement and underlying mechanism of miR-33a and its role in TGF-β1-induced hepatic fibrogenesis remains unknown. Here, we investigate the role of miR-33a in the activation of immortalized human HSCs, Lx-2 cells. Our findings have shown that the expression of miR-33a with its host gene sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2) was more highly expressed in activation of Lx-2 cells than in quiescent cells. The expression of miR-33a on TGF-β1-induced HSCs activation may be modulated via the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway. In addition, miR-33a significantly correlated with TGF-β1-induced expression of α1 (I) collagen (Col1A1) and α-SMA in HSCs. Bioinformatics analyses predict that peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-alpha (PPAR-α) is the potential target of miR-33a. We further found that anti-miR-33a significantly increases target gene PPAR-α mRNA and protein level, suggesting that miR-33a involved in HSCs function might be modulated by targeting PPAR-α. Finally, our results indicate that the expression of miR-33a increased with the progression of liver fibrosis. These results suggested that anti-miR-33a inhibit activation and extracellular matrix production, at least in part, via the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway and PPAR-α and anti sense of miR-33a may be a novel potential therapeutic approach for treating hepatic fibrosis in the future.

24103454	Title	MiR-23a-mediated inhibition of topoisomerase 1 expression potentiates cell response to etoposide in human hepatocellular carcinoma.
24103454	Abstract	microRNAs have been shown to regulate the chemosensitivity of cancer cells. The aim of this study is to investigate the role and mechanism of mir-23a in enhancing the anti-tumor effect of topoisomerase 2A (TOP2A) poison etoposide in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The anti-tumor effect of chemotherapeutic agents in HCC cells were examined in vitro and in vivo xenograft model. Expression of mRNA and miRNAs were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Protein expression was analyzed by immunoblotting. Overexpression of mir-23a could significantly potentiate the in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor effect of etoposide; however, ectopic expression of miR-23a fails to sensitize HCC cells to 5-fluorouracil treatment, indicating the miR-23a-induced cancer cell hypersensitivity in chemotherapy is TOP2A-specific though miR-23a overexpression could not directly up-regulate TOP2A expression. Topoisomerase 1(TOP1) is down-regulated in miR-23a-overexpressed HCC cells. MiR-23a could directly bind to 3'untranslated region of TOP1 mRNA, and suppress the corresponding protein expression and inhibition of miR-23a further arguments the expression of TOP1. MiR-23a was up-regulated during DNA damage in cancer cells in line with the p53 expression. Up-regulation of p53 induces mir-23a expression, while suppression of p53 inhibits miR-23a in HCC cells. Our study sheds light on the role of miR-23a as a potential target in regulating chemosensitivity of HCC cells.

24103701	Title	MicroRNA-mediated mechanism of vitamin D regulation of innate immune response.
24103701	Abstract	Macrophages play a critical role in innate immune response to protect the host from pathogenic microorganisms. Inflammatory response is regulated by negative feedback mechanisms to prevent detrimental effects. The SOCS family of proteins is key component of the negative feedback loop that regulates the intensity, duration and quality of cytokine signaling, whereas miR-155 is a key regulator of Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling that targets SOCS1 in activated macrophages to block the negative feedback loop. Recently we showed that 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) modulates innate immune response by targeting the miR-155-SOCS1 axis. We found that Vdr deletion leads to hyper inflammatory response in mice and macrophage cultures when challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), due to miR-155 overproduction to excessively suppress SOCS1. Using mice with bic/miR-155 deletion we confirmed that 1,25(OH)2D3 suppresses inflammation and stimulates SOCS1 by down-regulating miR-155. Mechanistically 1,25(OH)2D3 down-regulates bic transcription by blocking NF-κB activation, which is mediated by a κB cis-DNA element identified within the first intron of the bic gene. At the molecular level, we demonstrated that VDR inhibits NF-κB activation by directly interacting with IKKβ protein. Our studies identified a novel mechanism whereby VDR signaling attenuates TLR-mediated inflammation by enhancing the negative feedback regulation. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled '16th Vitamin D Workshop'.

24104199	Title	MicroRNA-561 promotes acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity in HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes through downregulation of the nuclear receptor corepressor dosage-sensitive sex-reversal adrenal hypoplasia congenital critical region on the X chromosome, gene 1 (DAX-1).
24104199	Abstract	One of the major mechanisms involved in acetaminophen (APAP)-induced hepatotoxicity is hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α)-mediated activation of pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). In the present study, we investigated the role of miR-561 and its target gene DAX-1 encoding a corepressor of HNF4α in the process of APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. We used both human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cell line (HepG2) cells and primary human hepatocytes in this study and monitored the levels of reactive oxygen species, lactate dehydrogenase, and glutathione. Our bioinformatics study suggests an association between miR-561 and DAX-1, but not HNF4α. Treatment of HepG2 cells with APAP significantly reduced the expression of DAX-1 in a concentration-dependent manner. miR-561 was induced by APAP treatment in HepG2 cells. Transfection of HepG2 cells with an miR-561 mimic exacerbated APAP-induced hepatotoxicity. HNF4α is physically associated with DAX-1 in HepG2 cells. A decreased protein level of DAX-1 by APAP treatment was also enhanced by miR-561 mimic transfection in HepG2 cells and primary human hepatocytes. The basal and APAP-induced expression of PXR and CAR was enhanced by miR-561 mimic transfection; however, transfection of HepG2 cells or primary human hepatocytes with a miR-561 inhibitor or DAX-1 small interfering RNA reversed these effects. Additionally, the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that recruitment of DAX-1 onto the PXR promoter was inversely correlated with the recruitment of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α coactivator-1α and HNF4α on APAP treatment. These results indicate that miR-561 worsens APAP-induced hepatotoxicity via inhibition of DAX-1 and consequent transactivation of nuclear receptors.

24105952	Title	The toll-like receptor 3 ligand, poly(I:C), improves immunosuppressive function and therapeutic effect of mesenchymal stem cells on sepsis via inhibiting MiR-143.
24105952	Abstract	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are attractive candidates for clinical therapeutic applications. Recent studies indicate MSCs express active Toll-like receptors (TLRs), but their effect on MSCs and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that, after treating human umbilical cord MSCs with various TLR ligands, only TLR3 ligand, poly(I:C), could significantly increase the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Furthermore, poly(I:C) could enhance MSCs' anti-inflammatory effect on macrophages. Next, we focused on the regulatory roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the process of poly(I:C) activating MSCs. Our experiments indicated that miR-143 expression was significantly decreased in MSCs with poly(I:C) treatment, and the expression level of miR-143 could regulate the effect of poly(I:C) on MSCs' immunosuppressive function. Subsequent results showed that the reporter genes with putative miR-143 binding sites from the transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) and COX-2 3' untranslated regions were downregulated in the presence of miR-143. In addition, mRNA and protein expression of TAK1 and COX-2 in MSCs was also downregulated with miR-143 overexpression, suggesting that TAK1 and COX-2 are target genes of miR-143 in MSCs. Consistent with miR-143 overexpression, TAK1 interference also attenuated MSCs' immunosuppressive function enhanced by poly(I:C). Additionally, it was shown that TLR3-activated MSCs could improve survival in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis, while miR-143 overexpression reduced the effectiveness of this therapy. These results proved that poly(I:C) improved the immunosuppressive abilities of MSCs, revealed the regulatory role of miRNAs in the process, and may provide an opportunity for potential novel therapies for sepsis.

24108762	Title	miR-106a confers cisplatin resistance by regulating PTEN/Akt pathway in gastric cancer cells.
24108762	Abstract	Recent studies have shown that microRNA-106a (miR-106a) is overexpressed in gastric cancer and contributes to tumor growth. In this study, we investigated whether miR-106a mediated resistance of the gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin (DDP). MiR-106a expression was up-regulated in the DDP resistant cell line SGC7901/DDP compared with its parental line SGC7901. Transfection of miR-106a induced DDP resistance in SGC7901, while suppression of miR-106a in SGC7901/DDP led to enhanced DDP cytotoxicity. Further study indicated that the mechanism of miR-106a-induced DDP resistance involved the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN) protein and its downstream phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. This study provides a novel mechanism of DDP resistance in gastric cancer.

24109547	Title	MiR-184 regulates insulin secretion through repression of Slc25a22.
24109547	Abstract	Insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells plays an essential role in blood glucose homeostasis and type 2 diabetes. Many genes are involved in the secretion of insulin and most of these genes can be targeted by microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the role of miRNAs in insulin secretion and type 2 diabetes has not been exhaustively studied. The expression miR-184, a miRNA enriched in pancreatic islets, negatively correlates with insulin secretion, suggesting that it is a good candidate for miRNA-mediated regulation of insulin secretion. Here we report that miR-184 inhibits insulin secretion in the MIN6 pancreatic β-cell line through the repression of its target Slc25a22, a mitochondrial glutamate carrier. Our study provides new insight into the regulation of insulin secretion by glutamate transport in mitochondria.

24112539	Title	MicroRNA-21 promotes hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell proliferation through repression of mitogen-activated protein kinase-kinase 3.
24112539	Abstract	microRNA 21 (miR-21) has been demonstrated to be significantly elevated in many types of cancers, including the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the present study, we investigated the role of miR-21 in HCC by identifying its novel targets, as well as its underlying molecular mechanism. The expression of mitogen-activated protein kinase-kinase 3 (MAP2K3) in human HCC tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues was determined by immunohistochemistry staining (IHC) analysis. The 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of MAP2K3 combined with miR-21 was experimentally verified by a miRNA luciferase reporter approach. Moreover, the role of miR-21 in regulating HCC cell proliferation was analyzed by an MTT assay infected with miR-21mimics/sponge inhibitor Adenoviral viral vectors. By immunohistochemistry staining analysis, we found that mitogen-activated protein kinase-kinase 3 (MAP2K3) was strikingly repressed in the human HCC tumor tissues, in comparison with the adjacent non-tumor tissues in clinical settings. More importantly, the repression of MAP2K3 was inversely correlated with the expression of miR-21 in HCC. Further study demonstrated that the MAP2K3 was a novel direct target of miR-21, which was experimentally validated by a miRNA luciferase reporter approach. In HepG2 cells, inhibition of miR-21 expression with an adenoviral miR-21 sponge vector profoundly suppressed cell proliferation by up-regulating MAP2K3 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. These results provide a clinical evidence that MAP2K3 may be a tumor repressor gene, and it is a direct target of miR-21 in HCC, indicating an underlying mechanism by which miR-21 is able to directly target MAP2K3 and inhibit its expression during the carcinogenesis of HCC, at both transcriptional and post-translational levels. This study also suggests that targeting miR-21-MAP2K3 pathway may be a promising strategy in the prevention and treatment of HCC.

24112607	Title	MiRNA-497 regulates cell growth and invasion by targeting cyclin E1 in breast cancer.
24112607	Abstract	MicroRNAs are a class of endogenous single strand non-coding RNAs that are involved in many important physiological and pathological processes. The purpose of this study was to examine the expression levels of miR-497 in human breast cancer and its function in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the expression levels of miR-497 in 40 breast cancer specimens and adjacent normal breast tissues. MTT assays, colony formation assays, wound healing assays, transwell assays and cell cycle assays were used to explore the potential function of miR-497 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assays were performed to analyze the regulation of putative target of miR-497, and western blot assays were used to validate the dual-luciferase results. The expression of miR-497 in breast cancer specimens was lower than adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.05). Overexpression of miR-497 inhibited cellular growth, suppressed cellular migration and invasion, and caused a G1 arrest. Dual-luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-497 binds the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of cyclin E1, suggesting that cyclin E1 is a direct target of miR-497. Western blot assays confirmed that overexpression of miR-497 reduced cyclin E1 protein levels. MiR-497 may act as a tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer. Inhibited cellular growth, suppressed cellular migration and invasion, and G1 cell cycle arrest were observed upon overexpression of miR-497 in cells, possibly by targeting cyclin E1. These results indicate miR-497 could be considered a therapeutic target for the development of treatment for breast cancer.

24113179	Title	miR-30e reciprocally regulates the differentiation of adipocytes and osteoblasts by directly targeting low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6.
24113179	Abstract	Reciprocal relationship usually exists between osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis, with factors stimulating one of these processes at the same time inhibiting the other. In the present study, miR-30e was found to be involved in the reciprocal regulation of osteoblast and adipocyte differentiation. Our data indicated that miR-30e was induced in primarily cultured mouse bone marrow stromal cell, mesenchymal cell line C3H10T1/2 and preadipocyte 3T3-L1 after adipogenic treatment. Conversely, it was reduced in mouse stromal line ST2 and preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 after osteogenic treatment. Enforced expression of miR-30e in 3T3-L1 significantly suppressed the growth of the cells and induced the preadipocytes to differentiate into mature adipocytes, along with increased expression of adipocyte-specific transcription factors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) and C/EBPβ, and the marker gene aP2. In contrast, inhibition of the endogenous miR-30e enhanced the cell growth and repressed preadipocytes to differentiate. Conversely, supplementing miR-30e activity blocked, whereas knocking down miR-30e enforced the preosteoblast MC3T3-E1 to fully differentiate. Furthermore, miR-30e overexpression stimulated adipocyte formation and inhibited osteoblast differentiation from marrow stromal cells. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6), one of the critical coreceptor for Wnts, was shown to be a direct target of miR-30e by using the luciferase assay. Knockdown of LRP6 in 3T3-L1 cells downregulated β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) transcriptional activity and dramatically potentiated the differentiation of the cells into mature adipocytes. Taken together, the present work suggests that the expression of miR-30e is indispensable for maintaining the balance of adipocytes and osteoblasts by targeting the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

24114198	Title	miR-320 regulates tumor angiogenesis driven by vascular endothelial cells in oral cancer by silencing neuropilin 1.
24114198	Abstract	Tumor angiogenesis is a critical process during cancer progression that modulates tumor growth and metastasis. Here, we identified an anti-angiogenic microRNA, miR-320, which is decreased in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines and tumor tissues from OSCC patients, down-regulated in blood vessels and inversely correlated with vascularity in OSCC tissues. Neuropilin 1 (NRP1), an important regulator of angiogenesis, was found to be a target of miR-320. The 3'-untranslated region of NRP1 mRNA contains multiple miR-320 binding sites, and its expression was regulated by miR-320. By administering either miR-320 precursor or antagonist, we found that miR-320 suppressed the migration, adhesion and tube formation of vascular endothelial cells. Knockdown of NRP1 abolished antagomiR-320-induced cell migration. Additionally, miR-320 expression was regulated by hypoxia in growth factor-deficient conditions by the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha. Furthermore, lentivirus carrying the miR-320 precursor suppressed the tumorigenicity of OSCC cells and tumor angiogenesis in vivo. Taken together, these data show that miR-320 regulates the function of vascular endothelial cells by targeting NRP1 and has the potential to be developed as an anti-angiogenic or anti-cancer drug.

24117217	Title	The miR-19a/b family positively regulates cardiomyocyte hypertrophy by targeting atrogin-1 and MuRF-1.
24117217	Abstract	Progressive cardiac hypertrophy owing to pathological stimuli, such as pressure overload, is frequently associated with the development of heart failure, a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Growing evidence has shown that miRNAs are extensively involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. In the present study, we examined the hypothesis that the miR-19a/b family acts as a key regulator of cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis. Forced overexpression of miR-19a/b was sufficient to induce hypertrophy in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Luciferase assays revealed that miR-19a/b directly target the anti-hypertrophic genes atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 (muscle RING-finger protein-1). The endogenous expressions of the target genes were down-regulated by miR-19a/b. Pro-hypertrophic calcineurin/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) signalling was elevated markedly in the presence of miR-19b, and the calcineurin inhibitor CsA (cyclosporin A) and the PKC (protein kinase C) inhibitor GF10923X significantly attenuated the miR-19b-mediated increase in cell size and expression of hypertrophic markers. Furthermore, miR-19b led to increased cell survival through up-regulation of the NFAT target gene encoding α-crystallin-B and repression of the pro-apoptotic gene Bim (Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death) under ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress conditions. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrate that the miR-19a/b family regulates phenotypes of cardiomyocytes via suppression of multiple direct target genes.

24122720	Title	MicroRNA-124 controls the proliferative, migratory, and inflammatory phenotype of pulmonary vascular fibroblasts.
24122720	Abstract	Pulmonary hypertensive remodeling is characterized by excessive proliferation, migration, and proinflammatory activation of adventitial fibroblasts. In culture, fibroblasts maintain a similar activated phenotype. The mechanisms responsible for generation/maintenance of this phenotype remain unknown. We hypothesized that aberrant expression of microRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates this activated fibroblast phenotype and sought to determine the signaling pathways through which miR-124 exerts effects. We detected significant decreases in miR-124 expression in fibroblasts isolated from calves and humans with severe pulmonary hypertension. Overexpression of miR-124 by mimic transfection significantly attenuated proliferation, migration, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression of hypertensive fibroblasts, whereas anti-miR-124 treatment of control fibroblasts resulted in their increased proliferation, migration, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression. Furthermore, the alternative splicing factor, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1, was shown to be a direct target of miR-124 and to be upregulated both in vivo and in vitro in bovine and human pulmonary hypertensive fibroblasts. The effects of miR-124 on fibroblast proliferation were mediated via direct binding to the 3' untranslated region of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 and subsequent regulation of Notch1/phosphatase and tensin homolog/FOXO3/p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 signaling. We showed that miR-124 directly regulates monocyte chemotactic protein-1 expression in pulmonary hypertension/idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension fibroblasts. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-124 expression is suppressed by histone deacetylases and that treatment of hypertensive fibroblasts with histone deacetylase inhibitors increased miR-124 expression and decreased proliferation and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 production. Stable decreases in miR-124 expression contribute to an epigenetically reprogrammed, highly proliferative, migratory, and inflammatory phenotype of hypertensive pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts. Thus, therapies directed at restoring miR-124 function, including histone deacetylase inhibitors, should be investigated.

24122827	Title	Epigenetic regulation of connective tissue growth factor by MicroRNA-214 delivery in exosomes from mouse or human hepatic stellate cells.
24122827	Abstract	Connective tissue growth factor (CCN2) drives fibrogenesis in hepatic stellate cells (HSC). Here we show that CCN2 up-regulation in fibrotic or steatotic livers, or in culture-activated or ethanol-treated primary mouse HSC, is associated with a reciprocal down-regulation of microRNA-214 (miR-214). By using protector or reporter assays to investigate the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of CCN2 mRNA, we found that induction of CCN2 expression in HSC by fibrosis-inducing stimuli was due to reduced expression of miR-214, which otherwise inhibited CCN2 expression by directly binding to the CCN2 3'-UTR. Additionally, miR-214 was present in HSC exosomes, which were bi-membrane vesicles, 50-150 nm in diameter, negatively charged (-26 mV), and positive for CD9. MiR-214 levels in exosomes but not in cell lysates were reduced by pretreatment of the cells with the exosome inhibitor, GW4869. Coculture of either quiescent HSC or miR-214-transfected activated HSC with CCN2 3'-UTR luciferase reporter-transfected recipient HSC resulted in miR-214- and exosome-dependent regulation of a wild-type CCN2 3'-UTR reporter but not of a mutant CCN2 3'-UTR reporter lacking the miR-214 binding site. Exosomes from HSC were a conduit for uptake of miR-214 by primary mouse hepatocytes. Down-regulation of CCN2 expression by miR-214 also occurred in human LX-2 HSC, consistent with a conserved miR-214 binding site in the human CCN2 3'-UTR. MiR-214 in LX-2 cells was shuttled by way of exosomes to recipient LX-2 cells or human HepG2 hepatocytes, resulting in suppression of CCN2 3'-UTR activity or expression of CCN2 downstream targets, including alpha smooth muscle actin or collagen. Experimental fibrosis in mice was associated with reduced circulating miR-214 levels. Exosomal transfer of miR-214 is a paradigm for the regulation of CCN2-dependent fibrogenesis and identifies fibrotic pathways as targets of intercellular regulation by exosomal miRs.

24123340	Title	An NTD-associated polymorphism in the 3' UTR of MTHFD1L can affect disease risk by altering miRNA binding.
24123340	Abstract	Maternal folate levels and polymorphisms in folate-related genes are known risk factors for neural tube defects (NTDs). SNPs in the mitochondrial folate gene MTHFD1L are associated with the risk of NTDs. We investigated whether different alleles of SNP rs7646 in the 3' UTR of MTHFD1L can be differentially regulated by microRNAs affecting MTHFD1L expression. We previously reported that miR-9 targets MTHFD1L and now we identify miR-197 as an additional miRNA regulator. Both of these miRNAs have predicted binding sites in the MTHFD1L 3' UTR in the region containing SNP rs7646. We have determined whether the alleles of SNP rs7646 (A/G) and miRNA expression levels affect miRNA binding preferences for the MTHFD1L 3' UTR and consequently MTHFD1L expression. Our results indicate that miR-9 and miR-197 specifically downregulate MTHFD1L levels in HEK293 and MCF-7 cells and that SNPrs7646 significantly affects miR-197 binding affinity to the MTHFD1L 3' UTR, causing more efficient posttranscriptional gene repression in the presence of the allele that is associated with increased risk of NTDs. These results reveal that the association of SNP rs7646 and NTD risk involves differences in microRNA regulation and, highlights the importance of genotype-dependent differential microRNA regulation in relation to human disease risk.

24123794	Title	Role of microRNA-27a in myoblast differentiation.
24123794	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous non-coding RNAs that are critically involved in roles in various aspects of skeletal myogenesis. microRNA miR-27a promotes myoblast proliferation by targeting myostatin, a critical inhibitor of skeletal muscle development, but its mode of action in myoblast differentiation remains unclear. We have found that expression of miR-27a and myostatin were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, during myoblast differentiation. Overexpression of miR-27a increased the number of myosin heavy chain (MHC)-positive cells and upregulated mRNA and protein of MyoD and myogenin. These findings indicate that miR-27a plays a role in enhancing myoblast differentiation.

24127040	Title	miR-133a suppresses ovarian cancer cell proliferation by directly targeting insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor.
24127040	Abstract	The microRNA miR-133a is dysregulated in many types of cancer, but the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we showed that the expression level of miR-133a was reduced in ovarian cancer tissues compared with normal ovaries. Ectopic expression of miR-133a significantly inhibited ovarian cancer cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced G1-phase cell cycle arrest, whereas decreased miR-133a expression dramatically enhanced cell proliferation and colony formation. Importantly, miR-133a overexpression suppressed in vivo tumor growth in nude mice models. Through in silico search, we found that the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) contains an evolutionarily conserved miR-133a binding site. miR-133a overexpression repressed IGF1R-3'UTR reporter activity, and reduced the mRNA and protein levels of endogenous IGF1R. Rescue experiments showed that ectopic expression of IGF1R significantly promoted the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells stably overexpressing miR-133a. Taken together, these findings indicate that miR-133a is an important regulator in ovarian cancer, and that its suppressive effects are mediated by targeting IGF1R.

24130168	Title	Characterization of microRNA-29 family expression and investigation of their mechanistic roles in gastric cancer.
24130168	Abstract	Increasing evidence shows that abnormal microRNAs (miRNAs) expression is involved in tumorigenesis. They might be the novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets in disease treatment. miR-29 family was previously reported to act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes in diverse cancers. However, their accurate expression, function and mechanism in gastric cancer (GC) are not well known. Here, we found that the expression of miR-29 family members was significantly reduced in GC compared with adjacent controls. Among them, miR-29c had the most reduced percentage in GC and was associated with aggressive and progressive phenotypes of GC. We further demonstrated that miR-29 family acted as tumor suppressors through targeting CCND2 and matrix metalloproteinase-2 genes in GC. Moreover, the inverse relationship between miR-29 family and their targets was verified in patients and xenograft mice. Finally, reintroduction of miR-29 family significantly inhibited tumor formation of GC cells in the xenograft mice. Take together, our finding characterized the expression properties of miR-29 family, contributed to the function and molecular mechanism of miR-29 family in GC and implied that miR-29 family might be employed as novel prognostic markers and therapeutic targets of GC.

24130493	Title	MicroRNA-155 promotes autophagy to eliminate intracellular mycobacteria by targeting Rheb.
24130493	Abstract	Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a hard-to-eradicate intracellular pathogen that infects one-third of the global population. It can live within macrophages owning to its ability to arrest phagolysosome biogenesis. Autophagy has recently been identified as an effective way to control the intracellular mycobacteria by enhancing phagosome maturation. In the present study, we demonstrate a novel role of miR-155 in regulating the autophagy-mediated anti-mycobacterial response. Both in vivo and in vitro studies showed that miR-155 expression was significantly enhanced after mycobacterial infection. Forced expression of miR-155 accelerated the autophagic response in macrophages, thus promoting the maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes and decreasing the survival rate of intracellular mycobacteria, while transfection with miR-155 inhibitor increased mycobacterial survival. However, macrophage-mediated mycobacterial phagocytosis was not affected after miR-155 overexpression or inhibition. Furthermore, blocking autophagy with specific inhibitor 3-methyladenine or silencing of autophagy related gene 7 (Atg7) reduced the ability of miR-155 to promote autophagy and mycobacterial elimination. More importantly, our study demonstrated that miR-155 bound to the 3'-untranslated region of Ras homologue enriched in brain (Rheb), a negative regulator of autophagy, accelerated the process of autophagy and sequential killing of intracellular mycobacteria by suppressing Rheb expression. Our results reveal a novel role of miR-155 in regulating autophagy-mediated mycobacterial elimination by targeting Rheb, and provide potential targets for clinical treatment.

24130753	Title	Chronic academic stress increases a group of microRNAs in peripheral blood.
24130753	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in regulation of cellular processes in response to changes in environment. In this study, we examined alterations in miRNA profiles in peripheral blood from 25 male medical students two months and two days before the National Examination for Medical Practitioners. Blood obtained one month after the examination were used as baseline controls. Levels of seven miRNAs (miR-16, -20b, -26b, -29a, -126, -144 and -144*) were significantly elevated during the pre-examination period in association with significant down-regulation of their target mRNAs (WNT4, CCM2, MAK, and FGFR1 mRNAs) two days before the examination. State anxiety assessed two months before the examination was positively and negatively correlated with miR-16 and its target WNT4 mRNA levels, respectively. Fold changes in miR-16 levels from two days before to one month after the examination were inversely correlated with those in WNT4 mRNA levels over the same time points. We also confirmed the interaction between miR-16 and WNT4 3'UTR in HEK293T cells overexpressing FLAG-tagged WNT4 3'UTR and miR-16. Thus, a distinct group of miRNAs in periheral blood may participate in the integrated response to chronic academic stress in healthy young men.

24130780	Title	Effects of microRNAs on fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) expression in hepatocarcinoma cells.
24130780	Abstract	Fucosyltransferase 8 (FUT8) catalyzes the transfer of α1,6-linked fucose to the first N-acetylglucosamine in N-linked glycans (core fucosylation). Increased core fucosylation has been reported during hepatocarcinogenesis, in both cell-associated and secreted proteins. Accordingly, increased core fucosylation of α-fetoprotein and α1-antitrypsin is currently used as a diagnostic and prognostic indicator. The present study provides new evidences that FUT8 can be regulated also through miRNA-mediated mechanisms. Using microRNA/target prediction programs, we identified miR-122 and miR-34a seed regions in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of FUT8. Then we used human and rodents hepatocarcinoma cell lines to evaluate the impact of transfection of miR-122 and miR-34a mimics on FUT8 mRNA and protein levels. This study demonstrated that forced expression of these miRNAs is able to induce a decrease of FUT8 levels and also to affect core fucosylation of secreted proteins. The ability of miR-122 and miR-34a to specifically interact with and regulate the 3'UTR of FUT8 was demonstrated via a luciferase reporter assay. Since miR-122 and miR-34a downregulation is a common feature in spontaneous human hepatocarcinoma, our finding that these miRNAs are able to target FUT8 3'UTR suggests that, together with transcriptional and other post-transcriptional systems, a miRNA-mediated mechanism could also be involved in the increased core fucosylation observed in liver tumors. Moreover, these findings also point out that miRNAs may be widely involved in the regulation of glycosylation machinery.

24132643	Title	EZH2-miR-30d-KPNB1 pathway regulates malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour cell survival and tumourigenesis.
24132643	Abstract	Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours (MPNSTs), which develop sporadically or from neurofibromatosis, recur frequently with high metastatic potential and poor outcome. The polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) is an important regulator for various human malignancies. However, the function of EZH2 in MPNSTs is unknown. Here we report that the EZH2-miR-30d-KPNB1 signalling pathway is critical for MPNST tumour cell survival in vitro and tumourigenicity in vivo. Up-regulated EZH2 in MPNST inhibits miR-30d transcription via promoter binding activity, leading to enhanced expression of the nuclear transport receptor KPNB1 that is inhibited by miR-30d targeting of KPNB1 3' UTR region. Furthermore, inhibition of EZH2 or KPNB1, or miR-30d over-expression, induces MPNST cell apoptosis in vitro and suppresses tumourigenesis in vivo. More importantly, forced over-expression of KPNB1 rescues MPNST cell apoptosis induced by EZH2 knockdown. Immunohistochemical analyses show that EZH2 and KPNB1 over-expression is observed in human MPNST specimens and is negatively associated with miR-30d expression. Our findings identify a novel signalling pathway involved in MPNST tumourigenesis, and also suggest that EZH2-miR-30d-KPNB1 signalling represents multiple potential therapeutic targetable nodes for MPNST.

24136232	Title	Heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor and miR-1192 exert opposite effect on Runx2-induced osteogenic differentiation.
24136232	Abstract	Osteoblast differentiation is a pivotal event in bone formation. Runt-related transcription factor-2 (Runx2) is an essential factor required for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. However, the underlying mechanism of Runx2-regulated osteogenic differentiation is still unclear. Here, we explored the corresponding mechanism using the C2C12/Runx2(Dox) subline, which expresses Runx2 in response to doxycycline (Dox). We found that Runx2-induced osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells results in a sustained decrease in the expression of heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family. Forced expression of HB-EGF or treatment with HB-EGF is capable of reducing the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), a defined marker of early osteoblast differentiation. HB-EGF-mediated inhibition of ALP depends upon activation of the EGFR and the downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways as well as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Runx2 specifically binds to the Hbegf promoter, suggesting that Hbegf transcription is directly inhibited by Runx2. Runx2 can upregulate miR-1192, which enhances Runx2-induced osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, miR-1192 directly targets Hbegf through translational inhibition, suggesting enhancement of Runx2-induced osteogenic differentiation by miR-1192 through the downregulation of HB-EGF. Taken together, our results suggest that Runx2 induces osteogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells by inactivating HB-EGF-EGFR signaling through the downregulation of HB-EGF via both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms.

24136787	Title	Strain-specific suppression of microRNA-320 by carcinogenic Helicobacter pylori promotes expression of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1.
24136787	Abstract	Helicobacter pylori is the strongest risk factor for gastric cancer, and strains harboring the cag pathogenicity island, which translocates the oncoprotein CagA into host cells, further augment cancer risk. We previously reported that in vivo adaptation of a noncarcinogenic H. pylori strain (B128) generated a derivative strain (7.13) with the ability to induce adenocarcinoma, providing a unique opportunity to define mechanisms that mediate gastric carcinogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate expression of oncogenes or tumor suppressors and are frequently dysregulated in carcinogenesis. To identify miRNAs and their targets involved in H. pylori-mediated carcinogenesis, miRNA microarrays were performed on RNA isolated from gastric epithelial cells cocultured with H. pylori strains B128, 7.13, or a 7.13 cagA(-) isogenic mutant. Among 61 miRNAs differentially expressed in a cagA-dependent manner, the tumor suppressor miR-320 was significantly downregulated by strain 7.13. Since miR-320 negatively regulates the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1, we demonstrated that H. pylori significantly induced Mcl-1 expression in a cagA-dependent manner and that suppression of Mcl-1 results in increased apoptosis. To extend these results, mice were challenged with H. pylori strain 7.13 or its cagA(-) mutant; consistent with cell culture data, H. pylori induced Mcl-1 expression in a cagA-dependent manner. In human subjects, cag(+) strains induced significantly higher levels of Mcl-1 than cag(-) strains, and Mcl-1 expression levels paralleled the severity of neoplastic lesions. Collectively, these results indicate that H. pylori suppresses miR-320, upregulates Mcl-1, and decreases apoptosis in a cagA-dependent manner, which likely confers an increased risk for gastric carcinogenesis.

24138392	Title	Curcumin up-regulates phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 through microRNA-mediated control of DNA methylation--a novel mechanism suppressing liver fibrosis.
24138392	Abstract	Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) has been reported to play a role in the suppression of activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that hypermethylation of the PTEN promoter is responsible for the loss of PTEN expression during HSC activation. Methylation is now established as a fundamental regulator of gene transcription. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), which can control gene expression by binding to their target genes for degradation and/or translational repression, were found to be involved in liver fibrosis. However, the mechanism responsible for miRNA-mediated epigenetic regulation in liver fibrosis still remained unclear. In the present study, curcumin treatment significantly resulted in the inhibition of cell proliferation and an increase in the apoptosis rate through the up-regulation of PTEN associated with a decreased DNA methylation level. Only DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b) was reduced in vivo and in vitro after curcumin treatment. Further studies were performed aiming to confirm that the knockdown of DNMT3b enhanced the loss of PTEN methylation by curcumin. In addition, miR-29b was involved in the hypomethylation of PTEN by curcumin. MiR-29b not only was increased by curcumin in activated HSCs, but also was confirmed to target DNMT3b by luciferase activity assays. Curcumin-mediated PTEN up-regulation, DNMT3b down-regulation and PTEN hypomethylation were all attenuated by miR-29b inhibitor. Collectively, it is demonstrated that curcumin can up-regulate miR-29b expression, resulting in DNMT3b down-regulation in HSCs and epigenetically-regulated PTEN involved in the suppression of activated HSCs. These results indicate that miRNA-mediated epigenetic regulation may be a novel mechanism suppressing liver fibrosis.

24139413	Title	MiR-378 inhibits progression of human gastric cancer MGC-803 cells by targeting MAPK1 in vitro.
24139413	Abstract	Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common cancers and the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. The discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) provides a new avenue for GC diagnostic and treatment regiments. Currently, a large number of miRNAs have been reported to be associated with the progression of GC, among which miR-378 has been examined to be downregulated in GC tissues and several cell lines. However, the function of miR-378 on GC cells and the mechanisms were less known. Here we found that ectopic expression of miR-378 could inhibit cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, cell migration as well as invasion, and induced cell apoptosis in GC cell line MGC-803. Moreover, we found that oncogene mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) was a target gene of miR-378 in GC cells, and the tumor-suppressive role of miR-378 might be achieved by the direct interaction with MAPK1. Taken together, our results showed that miR-378 might act as tumor suppressors in GC, and it may provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic options for human GC clinical operation in the future.

24140891	Title	Possible involvement of microRNAs in vascular damage in experimental chronic kidney disease.
24140891	Abstract	Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with vascular calcifications and atherosclerosis. There is a need for novel predictors to allow earlier diagnosis of these disorders, predict disease progression, and improve assessment of treatment response. We focused on microRNAs since they are implicated in a variety of cellular functions in cardiovascular pathology. We examined changes of microRNA expression in aortas of CKD and non-CKD wild type mice and apolipoprotein E knock-out mice, respectively. Both vascular smooth muscle-specific miR-143 and miR-145 expressions were decreased in states of atherosclerosis and/or CKD or both, and the expression level of protein target Myocardin was increased. The inflammatory miR-223 was increased in more advanced stages of CKD, and specific protein targets NFI-A and GLUT-4 were dramatically decreased. Expression of miR-126 was markedly increased and expression of protein targets VCAM-1 and SDF-1 was altered during the course of CKD. The drug sevelamer, commonly used in CKD, corrected partially these changes in microRNA expression, suggesting a direct link between the observed microRNA alterations and uremic vascular toxicity. Finally, miR-126, -143 and -223 expression levels were deregulated in murine serum during the course of experimental CKD. In conclusion, these miRNAs could have role(s) in CKD vascular remodeling and may therefore represent useful targets to prevent or treat complications of CKD.

24141696	Title	Tumor-suppressive microRNA-29a inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion via targeting HSP47 in cervical squamous cell carcinoma.
24141696	Abstract	Our recent studies of microRNA (miRNA) expression signatures indicated that microRNA-29a (miR-29a) was significantly downregulated in several types of human cancers, suggesting that miR-29a may be a putative tumor-suppressive miRNA in human cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional significance of miR-29a in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and to identify novel miR-29a-regulated cancer pathways and target genes involved in cervical SCC oncogenesis and metastasis. Restoration of miR-29a in cervical cancer cell lines (CaSKi, HeLa, ME180 and Yumoto) revealed that this miRNA significantly inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion. Gene expression data and in silico analysis demonstrated that heat-shock protein 47 (HSP47), a member of the serpin superfamily of serine proteinase inhibitors and a molecular chaperone involved in the maturation of collagen molecules, was a potential target of miR-29a regulation. Luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-29a directly regulated HSP47. Moreover, silencing of the HSP47 gene significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in cancer cells and the expression of HSP47 was upregulated in cancer tissues and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), as demonstrated by immunostaining. Downregulation of miR-29a was a frequent event in cervical SCC and miR-29a acted as a tumor suppressor by directly targeting HSP47. Recognition of tumor-suppressive miRNA-regulated molecular targets provides new insights into the potential mechanisms of cervical SCC oncogenesis and metastasis and suggests novel therapeutic strategies for treatment of this disease.

24141785	Title	MicroRNA-9 inhibits the proliferation of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells by suppressing expression of CXCR4 via the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
24141785	Abstract	Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been involved in the development and progression of malignancy. MicroRNA-9 (miR-9) has been confirmed to be underexpressed in many types of cancers. However, the relationship between miR-9 and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains largely unknown. Here we showed that the miR-9 was underexpressed in patients with OSCC and several OSCC cell lines. Lentivirus-mediated miR-9 overexpression in highly aggressive (Tca8113 and SCC-9) tumor cells significantly inhibited proliferation of the two cell lines in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that the CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) gene was a direct target of miR-9. RNA interference silencing of CXCR4 proved that miR-9 underexpression led to constitutive activation of β-catenin through activation of CXCR4 expression in OSCC cells. Finally, we also analyzed the possible relationship between miR-9 and the genes downstream of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in OSCC development and progression. These results provide new evidence of miR-9 as a promising tumor gene therapeutic target for OSCC patients.

24142150	Title	miR-331-3p regulates expression of neuropilin-2 in glioblastoma.
24142150	Abstract	Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs, has been implicated in the development and progression of high-grade gliomas. However, the precise mechanistic role of many miRNAs in this disease remains unclear. Here, we investigate the functional role of miR-331-3p in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We found that miR-331-3p expression in GBM cell lines is significantly lower than in normal brain, and that transient overexpression of miR-331-3p inhibits GBM cell line proliferation and clonogenic growth, suggesting a possible tumor suppressor role for miR-331-3p in this system. Bioinformatics analysis identified neuropilin-2 (NRP-2) as a putative target of miR-331-3p. Using transfection studies, we validated NRP-2 mRNA as a target of miR-331-3p in GBM cell lines, and show that NRP-2 expression is regulated by miR-331-3p. RNA interference (RNAi) to inhibit NRP-2 expression in vitro decreased the growth and clonogenic growth of GBM cell lines, providing further support for an oncogenic role for NRP-2 in high-grade gliomas. We also show that miR-331-3p inhibits GBM cell migration, an effect due in part to reduced NRP-2 expression. Finally, we identified a significant inverse correlation between miR-331-3p and NRP-2 expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas GBM cohort of 491 patients. Together, our results suggest that a loss of miR-331-3p expression contributes to GBM development and progression, at least in part via upregulating NRP-2 expression and increasing cell proliferation and clonogenic growth.

24142285	Title	Dynamic expression of miR-132, miR-212, and miR-146 in the brain of different hosts infected with Angiostrongylus cantonensis.
24142285	Abstract	Increasing evidence shows that microRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of regulatory molecules involved in many physiological processes, including the inflammation in central nervous system (CNS) and neurological disorders. Angiostrongylus cantonensis (A. cantonensis) is the major cause of human infectious eosinophilic meningitis and can induce CNS injury. In the present study, we investigated the expression of miRNAs involved in neuronal functions such as miR-132-3p/212-3p, and miR-146a-5p, inflammation-related miRNA, in the modulation of inflammation of CNS of mice and rats induced by A. cantonensis. The functions of differentially expressed miRNAs were analyzed through bioinformatics methods, and the expression of chosen target genes were investigated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that miR-146a-5p upregulated in the brain of rats after 21 days; A. cantonensis infection and the expression of miR-132-3p and miR-146a-5p upregulated in the brain of mice model infected by A. cantonensis. The expression of the target genes of mmu-miR-146a-5p such as Irak1 and Traf6 downregulated in 14 days and 21 days after A. cantonensis infection. Our results supply more information about the involvement of the miRNAs in the regulation of inflammation of CNS induced by A. cantonensis.

24143095	Title	Targeting miRNA-based medicines to cystic fibrosis airway epithelial cells using nanotechnology.
24143095	Abstract	Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disorder characterized by chronic airway inflammation. microRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small RNAs which act on messenger (m) RNA at a post transcriptional level, and there is a growing understanding that altered expression of miRNA is involved in the CF phenotype. Modulation of miRNA by replacement using miRNA mimics (premiRs) presents a new therapeutic paradigm for CF, but effective and safe methods of delivery to the CF epithelium are limiting clinical translation. Herein, polymeric nanoparticles are investigated for delivery of miRNA mimics into CF airway epithelial cells, using miR-126 as a proof-of-concept premiR cargo to determine efficiency. Two polymers, polyethyleneimine (PEI) and chitosan, were used to prepare miRNA nanomedicines, characterized for their size, surface (zeta) potential, and RNA complexation efficiency, and screened for delivery and cytotoxicity in CFBE41o- (human F508del cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator bronchial epithelial) cells using a novel high content analysis method. RNA extraction was carried out 24 hours post transfection, and miR-126 and TOM1 (target of Myb1) expression (a validated miR-126 target) was assessed. Manufacture was optimized to produce small nanoparticles that effectively complexed miRNA. Using high content analysis, PEI-based nanoparticles were more effective than chitosan-based nanoparticles in facilitating uptake of miRNA into CFBE41o- cells and this was confirmed in miR-126 assays. PEI-premiR-126 nanoparticles at low nitrogen/phosphate (N/P) ratios resulted in significant knockdown of TOM1 in CFBE41o- cells, with the most significant reduction of 66% in TOM1 expression elicited at an N/P ratio of 1:1 while chitosan-based miR-126 nanomedicines failed to facilitate statistically significant knockdown of TOM1 and both nanoparticles appeared relatively nontoxic. miRNA nanomedicine uptake can be qualitatively and quantitatively assessed rapidly by high content analysis and is highly polymer-dependent but, interestingly, there is not a direct correlation between the levels of miRNA uptake and the downstream gene knockdown. Polymeric nanoparticles can deliver premiRs effectively to CFBEs in order to modulate gene expression but must be tailored specifically for miRNA delivery.

24143215	Title	Identification of microRNAs that regulate TLR2-mediated trophoblast apoptosis and inhibition of IL-6 mRNA.
24143215	Abstract	While infection-induced placental inflammation is a common mechanism of adverse pregnancy outcome, some pathogens can also trigger placental apoptosis, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) mediate this response. Treatment of human first trimester trophoblast cells with bacterial peptidoglycan (PDG) reduces their constitutive secretion of IL-6 protein and induces apoptosis. This apoptotic response is dependent upon the cell's expression of TLR1, TLR2 and TLR10, and their lack of TLR6, such that ectopic expression of TLR6 prevents PDG-induced apoptosis and restores IL-6 production. In this current study we have identified three microRNAs (miRs) that regulate TLR2-mediated responses in the human trophoblast. Herein we report that miR-329 plays a pivotal role in mediating PDG-induced trophoblast apoptosis and inhibition of IL-6 mRNA expression by targeting the NF-κB subunit, p65. TLR2 activation by PDG upregulates miR-329 expression and inhibits NF-κB p65 and IL-6 mRNA, and this is reversed by the presence of TLR6. Moreover, inhibition of miR-329 prevents PDG-induced inhibition of NF-κB p65 and IL-6 mRNA expression, and restores cell survival. In addition, we have found miR-23a and let-7c to directly regulate PDG-mediated inhibition of IL-6 mRNA. TLR2 activation by PDG upregulates miR23a and let-7c expression and this is reversed by the presence of TLR6. Furthermore, inhibition of both miR23a and let-7c prevents PDG-inhibition of trophoblast IL-6 mRNA expression. Together, our findings suggest that multiple miRs are involved in the molecular regulation of TLR2-mediated responses in the trophoblast towards gram-positive bacterial components.

24145123	Title	miR-203 induces oxaliplatin resistance in colorectal cancer cells by negatively regulating ATM kinase.
24145123	Abstract	Chemotherapy for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) is the standard of care, but ultimately nearly all patients develop drug resistance. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to resistance to individual chemotherapeutic agents may help identify novel targets and drugs that will, in turn, improve therapy. Oxaliplatin is a common component combination therapeutic regimen for use in patients with metastatic CRC, but is also used as a component of adjuvant therapy for patients at risk for recurrent disease. In this study, unbiased microRNA array screening revealed that the miR-203 microRNA is up-regulated in three of three oxaliplatin-resistant CRC cell lines, and therefore we investigated the role of miR-203 in chemoresistance. Exogenous expression of miR-203 in chemo-naïve CRC cells induced oxaliplatin resistance. Knockdown of miR-203 sensitized chemoresistant CRC cells to oxaliplatin. In silico analysis identified ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a primary mediator of the DNA damage response, as a potential target of miR-203. ATM mRNA and protein levels were significantly down-regulated in CRC cells with acquired resistance to oxaliplatin. Using TCGA database, we identified a significant reverse correlation of miR-203 and ATM expression in CRC tissues. We validated ATM as a bona fide target of miR-203 in CRC cells. Mutation of the putative miR-203 binding site in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the ATM mRNA abolished the inhibitory effect of miR-203 on ATM. Furthermore, stable knockdown of ATM induced resistance to oxaliplatin in chemo-naïve CRC cells. This is the first report of oxaliplatin resistance in CRC cells induced by miR-203-mediated suppression of ATM.

24145127	Title	MicroRNA-224 is involved in the regulation of mouse cumulus expansion by targeting Ptx3.
24145127	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are indicated to regulate ovarian development in a cell- or stage-specific manner. Our previous study showed that miR-224 is involved in TGF-β1-mediated follicular granulosa cell (GC) growth and estradiol (E2) production during the transition from the preantral to early antral stage by targeting Smad4. In this study, miR-224 was found to target pentraxin 3 (Ptx3), a gene critical for cumulus expansion during ovulation. In addition, PTX3 was up-regulated in mouse mural GCs and cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) by TGF-β1 treatment, which was partially mediated by miR-224. The effect of miR-224 during ovulation was further examined in vitro and in vivo by construction of an adenovirus-mediated expression vector for miR-224 (Ad-miR-224). In vitro studies demonstrated that miR-224 could perturb cumulus expansion in EGF-stimulated COCs by decreasing PTX3 secretion. In vivo studies also showed that injection of Ad-miR-224 into ovarian bursa decreased PTX3 expression and disrupted ovulation, which led to a decreased number of implantation sites and offspring being born. These results indicate that miR-224 may affect ovulation and subsequent embryo development by targeting Ptx3, suggesting potential roles for miRNAs in offering new treatments for ovulation disorder-associated infertility, or, conversely, designing new contraceptives.

24146953	Title	Genetic variation in a microRNA-502 minding site in SET8 gene confers clinical outcome of non-small cell lung cancer in a Chinese population.
24146953	Abstract	Genetic variants may influence microRNA-target interaction through modulate their binding affinity, creating or destroying miRNA-binding sites. SET8, a member of the SET domain-containing methyltransferase, has been implicated in a variety array of biological processes. Using Taqman assay, we genotyped a polymorphism rs16917496 T>C within the miR-502 binding site in the 3'-untranslated region of the SET8 gene in 576 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Functions of rs16917496 were investigated using luciferase activity assay and validated by immunostaining. Log-rank test and cox regression indicated that the CC genotype was associated with a longer survival and a reduced risk of death for NSCLC [58.0 vs. 41.0 months, P = 0.031; hazard ratio = 0.44, 95% confidential interval: 0.26-0.74]. Further stepwise regression analysis suggested rs16917496 was an independently favorable factor for prognosis and the protective effect more prominent in never smokers, patients without diabetes and patients who received chemotherapy. A significant interaction was observed between rs16917496 and smoking status in relation to NSCLC survival (P<0.001). Luciferase activity assay showed a lower expression level for C allele as compared with T allele, and the miR-502 had an effect on modulation of SET8 gene in vitro. The CC genotype was associated with reduced SET8 protein expression based on immunostaining of 192 NSCLC tissue sample (P = 0.007). Lower levels of SET8 were associated with a non-significantly longer survival (55.0 vs. 43.1 months). Our data suggested that the rs16917496 T>C located at miR-502 binding site contributes to NSCLC survival by altering SET8 expression through modulating miRNA-target interaction.

24147004	Title	Cell survival following radiation exposure requires miR-525-3p mediated suppression of ARRB1 and TXN1.
24147004	Abstract	microRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that alter the stability and translation efficiency of messenger RNAs. Ionizing radiation (IR) induces rapid and selective changes in miRNA expression. Depletion of the miRNA processing enzymes Dicer or Ago2 reduces the capacity of cells to survive radiation exposure. Elucidation of critical radiation-regulated miRNAs and their target proteins offers a promising approach to identify new targets to increase the therapeutic effectiveness of the radiation treatment of cancer. Expression of miR-525-3p is rapidly up-regulated in response to radiation. Manipulation of miR-525-3p expression in irradiated cells confirmed that this miRNA mediates the radiosensitivity of a variety of non-transformed (RPE, HUVEC) and tumor-derived cell lines (HeLa, U2-Os, EA.hy926) cell lines. Thus, anti-miR-525-3p mediated inhibition of the increase in miR-525-3p elevated radiosensitivity, while overexpression of precursor miR-525-3p conferred radioresistance. Using a proteomic approach we identified 21 radiation-regulated proteins, of which 14 were found to be candidate targets for miR-525-3p-mediated repression. Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that nine of these were indeed direct targets of miR-525-3p repression. Individual analysis of these direct targets by RNAi-mediated knockdown established that ARRB1, TXN1 and HSPA9 are essential miR-525-3p-dependent regulators of radiation sensitivity. The transient up-regulation of miR-525-3p, and the resultant repression of its direct targets ARRB1, TXN1 and HSPA9, is required for cell survival following irradiation. The conserved function of miR-525-3p across several cell types makes this microRNA pathway a promising target for modifying the efficacy of radiotherapy.

24147106	Title	MicroRNA-34a enhances T cell activation by targeting diacylglycerol kinase ζ.
24147106	Abstract	The engagement of the T cell receptor (TCR) induces the generation of diacylglycerol (DAG), an important second messenger activating both the Ras/Erk and PKCθ/NFκB pathways. DAG kinases (DGKs) participate in the metabolism of DAG by converting it to phosphatidic acid. DGKζ has been demonstrated to be able to inhibit DAG signaling following TCR engagement. Deficiency of DGKζ increases the sensitivity of T cells to TCR stimulation, resulting in enhanced T cell activation ex vivo and in vivo. However, the mechanisms that control DGKζ expression are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that DGKζ mRNA is a direct target of a cellular microRNA miR-34a. The DGKζ transcript is decreased, whereas the primary miR-34a is upregulated upon TCR stimulation. Ectopic miR-34a expression suppresses DGKζ protein expression through the seed match binding to both the 3' untranslated region and coding region of DGKζ mRNA, leading to increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation and surface expression of the T cell activation marker CD69 following TCR cross-linking. In contrast, overexpression of a miR-34a competitive inhibitor increases DGKζ expression and suppresses TCR-mediated T cell activation. Together, our data demonstrate that miR-34a is a negative regulator for DGKζ and may play an important role in regulating T cell activation.

24147153	Title	MiR-221/222 target the DNA methyltransferase MGMT in glioma cells.
24147153	Abstract	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most deadly types of cancer. To date, the best clinical approach for treatment is based on administration of temozolomide (TMZ) in combination with radiotherapy. Much evidence suggests that the intracellular level of the alkylating enzyme O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) impacts response to TMZ in GBM patients. MGMT expression is regulated by the methylation of its promoter. However, evidence indicates that this is not the only regulatory mechanism present. Here, we describe a hitherto unknown microRNA-mediated mechanism of MGMT expression regulation. We show that miR-221 and miR-222 are upregulated in GMB patients and that these paralogues target MGMT mRNA, inducing greater TMZ-mediated cell death. However, miR-221/miR-222 also increase DNA damage and, thus, chromosomal rearrangements. Indeed, miR-221 overexpression in glioma cells led to an increase in markers of DNA damage, an effect rescued by re-expression of MGMT. Thus, chronic miR-221/222-mediated MGMT downregulation may render cells unable to repair genetic damage. This, associated also to miR-221/222 oncogenic potential, may poor GBM prognosis.

24148180	Title	MiR-370 sensitizes chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells to homoharringtonine by targeting Forkhead box M1.
24148180	Abstract	Homoharringtonine (HHT) is a kind of cephalotaxus alkaloid used in traditional Chinese medicine. Although HHT has been successfully used as a therapeutic agent for leukemia, the drug resistance and toxicity are major concerns. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified to modulate cellular sensitivity to anticancer drugs. We examined the synergistic action between miR-370 and HHT in vitro and in vivo. The synergistic action between miR-370 and HHT was examined by flow cytometry. The effect of HHT on miR-370 expression was determined by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). The expression of miR-370 and Forkhead box M1 (FoxM1) in 23 patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML-CP) and 10 patients with blast-crisis CML (CML-BP) as well as miR-370-targeted FoxM1 was determined by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis. Ectopic expression of miR-370 sensitized the CML K562 cell line to HHT by targeting FoxM1, the major regulator in cell proliferation and apoptosis. miR-370 significantly promoted HHT-mediated cell apoptosis and miR-370 and HHT cooperated in affecting FoxM1 expression. As well, miR-370 was moderately upregulated after HHT treatment in K562 cells. In addition, the expression of miR-370 was significantly reduced in CML patients as compared with healthy controls. Furthermore, the expression of miR-370 was lower in CML-BP than CML-CP patients. MiR-370 sensitized K562 cells to HHT by inducing apoptosis in part by downregulation of FoxM1 expression. These findings may provide further information for CML treatment with HHT.

24149516	Title	MiR199a is implicated in embryo implantation by regulating Grb10 in rat.
24149516	Abstract	MiR199a was found to be differentially expressed in rat uteri between the prereceptive and receptive phase via microRNA (miRNA) microarray analysis in our previous study. However, the role of miR199a in rat embryo implantation remained unknown. In the study, northern blot results showed that the expression levels of miR199a were higher on gestation days 5 and 6 (g.d.5-6) in rat uteri than on g.d.3-4 and g.d.7-8. In situ localization of miR199a in rat uteri showed that miR199a was mainly localized in the stroma or decidua. The expression of miR199a was not significantly different in the uteri of pseudopregnant rats and evidently increased in the uteri of rats subjected to activation of delayed implantation and experimentally induced decidualization. Treatment with 17β-estradiol or both 17β-estradiol and progesterone significantly diminished miR199a levels. Gain of function of miR199a in endometrial stromal cells isolated from rat uteri inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis. Loss of function of miR199a displayed opposite roles on cell proliferation and apoptosis. Further investigation uncovered a significant inverse association between the expression of miR199a and growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (Grb10), an imprinted gene, and miR199a could bind to the 3'UTR of Grb10 to inhibit Grb10 translation. In addition, in vivo analysis found that the immunostaining of GRB10 was attenuated in the stroma or decidua from g.d.4 to 6, contrary to the enhancement of miR199a. Collectively, upregulation of miR199a in rat uterus during the receptive phase is regulated by blastocyst activation and uterine decidualization. Enforced miR199a expression suppresses cell proliferation partially through targeting Grb10.

24149576	Title	Akt-p53-miR-365-cyclin D1/cdc25A axis contributes to gastric tumorigenesis induced by PTEN deficiency.
24149576	Abstract	Although PTEN/Akt signaling is frequently deregulated in human gastric cancers, the in vivo causal link between its dysregulation and gastric tumorigenesis has not been established. Here we show that inactivation of PTEN in mouse gastric epithelium initiates spontaneous carcinogenesis with complete penetrance by 2 months of age. Mechanistically, activation of Akt suppresses the abundance of p53, leading to decreased transcription of miR-365, thus causing upregulation of cyclin D1 and cdc25A, which promotes gastric cell proliferation. Importantly, genetic ablation of Akt1 restores miR-365 expression and effectively rescues gastric tumorigenesis in PTEN-mutant mice. Moreover, orthotopic restoration of miR-365 represses PTEN-deficient-induced hyperplasia. In human gastric cancer tissues, miR-365 reduction correlates with poorly differentiated histology, deep invasion and advanced stage, as well as the deregulation of PTEN, phosphorylated Akt, p53, cyclin D1 and cdc25A. These data demonstrate that the PTEN-Akt-p53-miR-365-cyclin D1/cdc25A axis serves as a new mechanism underlying gastric tumorigenesis, providing potential new therapeutic targets.

24149837	Title	Increased expression of miR-187 in human islets from individuals with type 2 diabetes is associated with reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.
24149837	Abstract	Type 2 diabetes is characterised by progressive beta cell dysfunction, with changes in gene expression playing a crucial role in its development. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression and therefore alterations in miRNA levels may be involved in the deterioration of beta cell function. Global TaqMan arrays and individual TaqMan assays were used to measure islet miRNA expression in discovery (n = 20) and replication (n = 20) cohorts from individuals with and without type 2 diabetes. The role of specific dysregulated miRNAs in regulating insulin secretion, content and apoptosis was subsequently investigated in primary rat islets and INS-1 cells. Identification of miRNA targets was assessed using luciferase assays and by measuring mRNA levels. In the discovery and replication cohorts miR-187 expression was found to be significantly increased in islets from individuals with type 2 diabetes compared with matched controls. An inverse correlation between miR-187 levels and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) was observed in islets from normoglycaemic donors. This correlation paralleled findings in primary rat islets and INS-1 cells where overexpression of miR-187 markedly decreased GSIS without affecting insulin content or apoptotic index. Finally, the gene encoding homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-3 (HIPK3), a known regulator of insulin secretion, was identified as a direct target of miR-187 and displayed reduced expression in islets from individuals with type 2 diabetes. Our findings suggest a role for miR-187 in the blunting of insulin secretion, potentially involving regulation of HIPK3, which occurs during the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.

24151081	Title	MicroRNA-200b stimulates tumour growth in TGFBR2-null colorectal cancers by negatively regulating p27/kip1.
24151081	Abstract	Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the most common malignancy worldwide. TGF-β1 is often overexpressed in late stages of colorectal carcinogenesis and promotes tumour growth and metastasis. Several reports have verified that the loss of functional TGFBRII expression contributed to escape the tumour suppressor activity of TGF-β1 and that the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) responded to TGF-β1 involved in tumour invasion and metastasis. However, the mechanisms by which TGF-β1 confers a growth advantage to TGFBRII-null colorectal cancer cells have not been elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional inhibitory regulators of gene expression that act by directly binding complementary mRNA and are key determinants of cancer initiation and progression. In this study, we revealed a role for miR-200b in colorectal cancer. MiR-200b was highly expressed in TGFBRII-null tumour tissues and colorectal cancer cell lines and positively correlated with cell proliferation in tumour tissues and cell lines. In contrast, decreasing the miR-200b level in TGFBRII-null cells suppressed cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Furthermore, in vivo studies also suggested a stimulating effect of miR-200b on TGFBRII-null cell-derived xenografts. CDKN1B (p27/kip1) and RND3 (RhoE) have miR-200b binding sequences within their 3' untranslated regions and were confirmed to be direct targets of miR-200b using fluorescent reporter assays. Meanwhile, CDKN1B (p27/kip1) played a role in miR-200b-stimulated TGFBR-null CRC. This study suggests that miR-200b plays a tumour-promoting role by targeting CDKN1B (p27/kip1) in CRCs.

24151514	Title	Upregulated microRNA-155 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and fibroblast-like synoviocytes in rheumatoid arthritis.
24151514	Abstract	This study was to screen for the miRNAs differently expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of RA, to further identify the expression of miR-155 in RA PBMC and fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS), and to evaluate the function of miR-155 in RA-FLS. Microarray was used to screen for differentially expressed miRNAs in RA PBMC. miR-155 expression in PBMC and FLS of RA were identified by real-time PCR. Enforced overexpression and downexpression of miR-155 were used to investigate the function of miR-155 in RA-FLS. Expression of IKBKE which was previously identified as the actual target of miR-155 was examined by Western blot and real-time PCR in RA-FLS. miR-155 levels were increased in both PBMC and FLS of RA and could be induced by TNF- α . Upregulation of miR-155 decreased MMP-3 levels and suppressed proliferation and invasion of RA-FLS. Inverse relationship between the expressions of miR-155 and the MMPs production-related protein IKBKE was found. An inflammatory milieu may alter miRNA expression profiles in rheumatoid arthritis. miR-155 is upregulated in RA-FLS, and it may be a protective factor against the inflammatory effect in part by attenuating expression of IKBKE.

24152184	Title	MiR-155 promotes proliferation of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells through targeting tumor protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1.
24152184	Abstract	MiR-155 has emerged as an "oncomiR", which is the most significantly up-regulated miRNA in breast cancer. However, the mechanisms of miR-155 functions as an oncomiR are mainly unknown. In this study, the aims were to investigate the effects of miR-155 on cell proliferation, cell cycle, and cell apoptosis of ERalpha (+) breast cancer cells and to verify whether TP53INP1 (tumor protein 53-induced nuclear protein 1) is a target of miR-155, and tried to explore the mechanisms of miR-155 in this process. The expression of miR-155 is significantly higher in MCF-7 cells compared with MDA-MB-231 cells. Ectopic expression of TP53INP1 inhibits growth of MCF-7 cells by inducing cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell cycle progression. Overexpression of miR-155 increases cell proliferation and suppress cell apoptosis, whereas abrogating expression of miR-155 suppress cell proliferation and promotes cell apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. In addition, miR-155 negatively regulates TP53INP1 mRNA expression and the protein expression of TP53INP1, cleaved-caspase-3, -8, -9, and p21, and luciferase reporter reveals that TP53INP1 is targeted by miR-155. TP53INP1 is the direct target of miR-155. MiR-155, which is overexpressed in MCF-7 cells, contributes to proliferation of MCF-7 cells possibly through down-regulating target TP53INP1.

24154840	Title	The microRNA-21/PTEN pathway regulates the sensitivity of HER2-positive gastric cancer cells to trastuzumab.
24154840	Abstract	The ToGA trial demonstrated the significant efficacy of trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer (GC). Although trastuzumab has become a key drug in breast cancer treatment, resistance to trastuzumab is a major problem in clinical practice. The aim of the current study was to identify the micro-RNA (miR)/gene pathway regulating the sensitivity of HER2-positive GC cells to trastuzumab. Correlations between the expression levels of miR-21, PTEN, and p-AKT were analyzed by real-time PCR and Western blot test in HER2-positive GC cell lines. The effects of overexpression or suppression of miR-21 on the sensitivity of GC cells to trastuzumab were also analyzed in vitro. Overexpression of miR-21 down-regulated PTEN expression, increased AKT phosphorylation, and did not affect HER2 expression. Inversely, suppression of miR-21 increased PTEN expression and down-regulated AKT phosphorylation, but still did not affect HER2 expression. Overexpression of miR-21 decreased the sensitivity of GC cells to trastuzumab, while suppression of miR-21 expression restored the resistance of GC cells to trastuzumab. Overexpression of miR-21 significantly suppressed trastuzumab-induced apoptosis. To our knowledge, this study was the first reveal the miR-21/PTEN pathway regulated the sensitivity of HER2-positive GC cell lines to trastuzumab through modulation apoptosis. These findings suggest that this pathway may be crucial to the mechanism of resistance to trastuzumab in GC, which may lead to the development of individualized treatment in clinical practice.

24154848	Title	microRNA-27a functions as a tumor suppressor in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by targeting KRAS.
24154848	Abstract	microRNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested to play a vital role in regulating tumor progression and invasion. However, the expression of miR-27a in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and its effect on the tumorigenesis of ESCC are unclear. In the present study, we found that miR-27a was downregulated in esophageal carcinoma cell lines and ESCC specimens with lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-27a binds to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of KRAS and inhibits the expression of the KRAS protein. miR-27a levels were inversely correlated with levels of KRAS mRNA and protein in ESCC specimens. Both in vitro and in vivo assays revealed that miR-27a attenuated ESCC proliferation, invasion and tumor growth in nude mice. miR-27a exerts its tumor suppressor function through inhibition of the KRAS-related ERK pathways. Our findings suggest, for the first time, that miR-27a suppresses tumorigenesis of ESCC by targeting KRAS.

24155407	Title	Genomewide mapping and screening of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) 3' untranslated regions identify bicistronic and polycistronic viral transcripts as frequent targets of KSHV microRNAs.
24155407	Abstract	Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes over 90 genes and 25 microRNAs (miRNAs). The KSHV life cycle is tightly regulated to ensure persistent infection in the host. In particular, miRNAs, which primarily exert their effects by binding to the 3' untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of target transcripts, have recently emerged as key regulators of KSHV life cycle. Although studies with RNA cross-linking immunoprecipitation approach have identified numerous targets of KSHV miRNAs, few of these targets are of viral origin because most KSHV 3'UTRs have not been characterized. Thus, the extents of viral genes targeted by KSHV miRNAs remain elusive. Here, we report the mapping of the 3'UTRs of 74 KSHV genes and the effects of KSHV miRNAs on the control of these 3'UTR-mediated gene expressions. This analysis reveals new bicistronic and polycistronic transcripts of KSHV genes. Due to the 5'-distal open reading frames (ORFs), KSHV bicistronic or polycistronic transcripts have significantly longer 3'UTRs than do KSHV monocistronic transcripts. Furthermore, screening of the 3'UTR reporters has identified 28 potential new targets of KSHV miRNAs, of which 11 (39%) are bicistronic or polycistronic transcripts. Reporter mutagenesis demonstrates that miR-K3 specifically targets ORF31-33 transcripts at the lytic locus via two binding sites in the ORF33 coding region, whereas miR-K10a-3p and miR-K10b-3p and their variants target ORF71-73 transcripts at the latent locus through distinct binding sites in both 5'-distal ORFs and intergenic regions. Our results indicate that KSHV miRNAs frequently target the 5'-distal coding regions of bicistronic or polycistronic transcripts and highlight the unique features of KSHV miRNAs in regulating gene expression and life cycle.

24155920	Title	Involvement of miRNAs in the differentiation of human glioblastoma multiforme stem-like cells.
24155920	Abstract	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)-initiating cells (GICs) represent a tumor subpopulation with neural stem cell-like properties that is responsible for the development, progression and therapeutic resistance of human GBM. We have recently shown that blockade of NFκB pathway promotes terminal differentiation and senescence of GICs both in vitro and in vivo, indicating that induction of differentiation may be a potential therapeutic strategy for GBM. MicroRNAs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of GBM, but a high-throughput analysis of their role in GIC differentiation has not been reported. We have established human GIC cell lines that can be efficiently differentiated into cells expressing astrocytic and neuronal lineage markers. Using this in vitro system, a microarray-based high-throughput analysis to determine global expression changes of microRNAs during differentiation of GICs was performed. A number of changes in the levels of microRNAs were detected in differentiating GICs, including over-expression of hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-29a, hsa-miR-29b, hsa-miR-221 and hsa-miR-222, and down-regulation of hsa-miR-93 and hsa-miR-106a. Functional studies showed that miR-21 over-expression in GICs induced comparable cell differentiation features and targeted SPRY1 mRNA, which encodes for a negative regulator of neural stem-cell differentiation. In addition, miR-221 and miR-222 inhibition in differentiated cells restored the expression of stem cell markers while reducing differentiation markers. Finally, miR-29a and miR-29b targeted MCL1 mRNA in GICs and increased apoptosis. Our study uncovers the microRNA dynamic expression changes occurring during differentiation of GICs, and identifies miR-21 and miR-221/222 as key regulators of this process.

24156637	Title	Reversible, interrelated mRNA and miRNA expression patterns in the transcriptome of Rasless fibroblasts: functional and mechanistic implications.
24156637	Abstract	4-Hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHT) triggers Cre-mediated K-Ras removal in [H-Ras-/-; N-Ras-/-; K-Ras lox/lox; RERT ert/ert] fibroblasts, generating growth-arrested "Rasless" MEFs which are able to recover their proliferative ability after ectopic expression of Ras oncoproteins or constitutively active BRAF or MEK1. Comparison of the transcriptional profiles of Rasless fibroblasts with those of MEFs lacking only H-Ras and N-Ras identified a series of differentially expressed mRNAs and microRNAs specifically linked to the disappearance of K-Ras from these cells. The rescue of cell cycle progression in Rasless cells by activated BRAF or MEK1 resulted in the reversal of most such transcriptional mRNA and microRNA alterations.Functional analysis of the differentially expressed mRNAs uncovered a significant enrichment in the components of pathways regulating cell division, DNA/RNA processing and response to DNA damage. Consistent with G1/S blockade, Rasless cells displayed repression of a series of cell cycle-related genes, including Cyclins, Cyclin-dependent kinases, Myc and E2F transcription targets, and upregulation of Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. The profile of differentially expressed microRNAs included a specific set of oncomiR families and clusters (repressed miR-17 ~ 92, miR-106a ~ 363, miR-106b ~ 25, miR-212 ~ 132, miR-183 ~ 182, and upregulated miR-335) known for their ability to target a specific set of cellular regulators and checkpoint sensors (including Rb, E2F and Cdkns) able to modulate the interplay between the pro- and anti-proliferative or stress-response pathways that are reversibly altered in Rasless cells. Our data suggest that the reversible proliferation phenotype of Rasless cells is the pleiotropic result of interplay among distinct pro- and anti-proliferative, and stress-response pathways modulated by a regulatory circuitry constituted by a specific set of differentially expressed mRNAs and microRNAs and preferentially targeting two cross-talking signalling axes: Myc-Rb-E2F-dependent and Cdkns-p53-dependent pathways.

24157866	Title	Tumor suppressor PDCD4 modulates miR-184-mediated direct suppression of C-MYC and BCL2 blocking cell growth and survival in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
24157866	Abstract	Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), a novel tumor suppressor, inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion as well as promotes cell apoptosis in tumors. However, the molecular mechanism of its tumor-suppressive function remains largely unknown in tumors including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). In this study, downregulated PDCD4 expression was significantly associated with the status of NPC progression and poor prognosis. PDCD4 markedly suppressed the ability of cell proliferation and cell survival by modulating C-MYC-controlled cell cycle and BCL-2-mediated mitochondrion apoptosis resistance signals, and oncogenic transcription factor C-JUN in NPC. Furthermore, miR-184, a tumor-suppressive miRNA modulated by PDCD4 directly targeting BCL2 and C-MYC, participated in PDCD4-mediated suppression of cell proliferation and survival in NPC. Further, we found that PDCD4 decreased the binding of C-Jun to the AP-1 element on the miR-184 promoter regions by PI3K/AKT/JNK/C-Jun pathway and stimulated miR-184 expression. In clinical fresh specimens, reduced PDCD4 mRNA level was positively correlated with miR-184 expression in NPC. Our studies are the first to demonstrate that PDCD4 as tumor suppressor regulated miR-184-mediated direct targeting of BCL2 and C-MYC via PI3K/AKT and JNK/C-Jun pathway attenuating cell proliferation and survival in NPC.

24161443	Title	Aldose reductase regulates miR-200a-3p/141-3p to coordinate Keap1-Nrf2, Tgfβ1/2, and Zeb1/2 signaling in renal mesangial cells and the renal cortex of diabetic mice.
24161443	Abstract	Aberrant regulation in oxidative stress, fibrogenesis, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in renal cells under hyperglycemic conditions contributes significantly to the onset and progression of diabetic nephropathy. The mechanisms underlying these hyperglycemia-induced dysregulations, however, have not been clearly elucidated. Herein, we report that aldose reductase is capable of regulating the expression of miR-200a-3p/141-3p negatively in renal mesangial cells. MiR-200a-3p/141-3p, in turn, act to target Keap1, Tgfβ2, fibronectin, and Zeb2 directly and regulate Tgfβ1 and Nrf2 indirectly under high-glucose conditions, resulting in profound dysregulations in Keap1-Nrf2, Tgfβ1/2, and Zeb1/2 signaling. In vivo in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, we found that aldose reductase deficiency caused significant elevations in miR-200a-3p/141-3p in the renal cortex, which were accompanied by a significant downregulation of Keap1, Tgfβ1/2, and fibronectin but significant upregulation of Nrf2. Moreover, in vivo administration of inhibitors of miR-200a-3p in diabetic animals significantly exacerbated cortical and glomerular fibrogenesis and increased urinary albumin excretion, tightly linking dysregulated miR-200a-3p with the development of diabetic nephropathy. Collectively, our results reveal a novel mechanism whereby hyperglycemia induces aldose reductase to regulate renal expression of miR-200a-3p/141-3p to coordinately control hyperglycemia-induced renal oxidative stress, fibrogenesis, and the EMT. Our novel findings also suggest that inhibition of aldose reductase and in vivo renal cortical restoration of miR-200a-3p/141-3p or their combination are very promising avenues for the development of therapeutic strategies or drugs against diabetic nephropathy.

24164962	Title	Downregulation of miR-106b induced breast cancer cell invasion and motility in association with overexpression of matrix metalloproteinase 2.
24164962	Abstract	Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers in women, and it can often metastasize to the bone. The mechanism of BC bone metastasis remains unclear and requires in-depth investigation. In a previous study, we found the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) to be significantly more pronounced at metastatic bone sites than at orthotopic sites. MicroRNA expression profiling showed miR-106b to be markedly downregulated during BC bone metastasis. However, the specific manner in which MMP2 and miR-106b are involved in the BC bone metastasis is still unclear. In the present study, we found MMP2 expression in orthotopic tumor tissue to be related to the risk of bone metastasis in BC patients. MiR-106b levels in orthotopic tumor tissue showed a negative correlation with MMP2 expression and breast cancer bone metastasis. MMP2 was shown to be a direct target of miR-106b. Both gain- and loss-of-function studies showed that MMP2 could promote the migration and invasion of BC cells and that miR-106b could suppress both. The blockage of MMP2 by RNA interference mimicked the anti-migration and anti-invasion effects of miR-106b, and introduction of MMP2 antagonized the function of miR-106b. MMP2 was also found to regulate the ERK signaling cascade and so adjust the bone microenvironment to favor osteoclastogenesis and bone metastasis. These results suggest that MMP2 upregulation plays an important role in BC bone metastasis through ERK pathways, and miR-106b directly regulates MMP2 expression. The miR-106b/MMP2/ERK pathway may be a promising therapeutic target for inhibiting BC bone metastasis.

24165569	Title	miR-125b targets erythropoietin and its receptor and their expression correlates with metastatic potential and ERBB2/HER2 expression.
24165569	Abstract	The microRNA 125b is a double-faced gene expression regulator described both as a tumor suppressor gene (in solid tumors) and an oncogene (in hematologic malignancies). In human breast cancer, it is one of the most down-regulated miRNAs and is able to modulate ERBB2/3 expression. Here, we investigated its targets in breast cancer cell lines after miRNA-mimic transfection. We examined the interactions of the validated targets with ERBB2 oncogene and the correlation of miR-125b expression with clinical variables. MiR-125b possible targets were identified after transfecting a miRNA-mimic in MCF7 cell line and analyzing gene expression modifications with Agilent microarrays and Sylamer bioinformatic tool. Erythropoietin (EPO) and its receptor (EPOR) were validated as targets of miR-125b by luciferase assay and their expression was assessed by RT-qPCR in 42 breast cancers and 13 normal samples. The molecular talk between EPOR and ERBB2 transcripts, through miR-125b, was explored transfecting MDA-MD-453 and MDA-MB-157 with ERBB2 RNA and using RT-qPCR. We identified a panel of genes down-regulated after miR-125b transfection and putative targets of miR-125b. Among them, we validated erythropoietin (EPO) and its receptor (EPOR) - frequently overexpressed in breast cancer--as true targets of miR-125b. Moreover, we explored possible correlations with clinical variables and we found a down-regulation of miR-125b in metastatic breast cancers and a significant positive correlation between EPOR and ERBB2/HER2 levels, that are both targets of miR-125b and function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). Taken together our results show a mechanism for EPO/EPOR and ERBB2 co-regulation in breast cancer and confirm the importance of miR-125b in controlling clinically-relevant cancer features.

24166354	Title	MicroRNA-124 (miR-124) regulates Ku70 expression and is correlated with neuronal death induced by ischemia/reperfusion.
24166354	Abstract	MicroRNAs are small, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression, and miR-124 is the most abundant miRNA in the brain. Studies have shown that miR-124 is clearly reduced in the ischemic brain after stroke; however, the role of miR-124 after stroke is less well studied. Using TargetScan, MicroCosm Targets version 5, and microRNA.org databases, we identified miR-124 as a possible regulator of the DNA repair protein Ku70. We validated that Ku70 is a target for miR-124 with a luciferase reporter activity assay. Moreover, adult rats subjected to focal cerebral ischemia exhibited a substantial reduction of miR-124 expression, which was inversely upregulated by Ku70 expression. In vivo treatment with miR-124 antagomir effectively enhanced Ku70 mRNA and protein levels in the ischemic region. Furthermore, knockdown of cerebral miR-124 reduced cell death and infarct size and improved neurological outcomes. Our data demonstrate that miR-124 is an endogenous regulator of Ku70 that improves ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced brain injury and dysfunction.

24166509	Title	MicroRNA-106b-5p boosts glioma tumorigensis by targeting multiple tumor suppressor genes.
24166509	Abstract	Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been implicated in cancer initiation and progression. However, little is known about the potential role of miRNAs in glioma tumorigenesis. In this study, we found that miRNA-106b-5p was significantly upregulated in glioma tumor samples and cell lines compared with normal brain tissues, and its expression level correlated with the pathological grading. Overexpression of miR-106b-5p in glioma tumor cells significantly promoted cell proliferation, although inhibited cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, knockdown of miR-106b-5p significantly inhibited cell proliferation, although enhanced cell apoptosis. Mechanistic study revealed that two target genes, retinoblastoma-like 1 (RBL1) and RBL2, were involved in miR-106b-5p's regulation of cell proliferation and one target gene, caspase-8 (CASP8), mediated miR-106b-5p's regulation of apoptosis. We also investigated the function of the three targets in glioma tumorigenesis by RNA interference manipulation and demonstrated that knockdown of these target genes led to cell proliferation enhancement or cell apoptosis inhibition in vitro. More interestingly, the expression levels of these targets were significantly downregulated in glioma samples and knockdown of these targets in glioma cells inhibited the xenograft tumor formation in vivo. Moreover, we verified the regulation function of miR-106b-5p and its targets on cell proliferation and apoptosis of the primary cultured astrocytes isolated from glioma tumor samples and healthy controls. Collectively, our findings show the critical roles of miR-106b-5p and its targets, RBL1, RBL2 and CASP8, in glioma tumorigenesis and provide potential candidates for malignant glioma therapy.

24167472	Title	MicroRNA-431 regulates axon regeneration in mature sensory neurons by targeting the Wnt antagonist Kremen1.
24167472	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding RNAs that function as key post-transcriptional regulators in neural development, brain function, and neurological diseases. Growing evidence indicates that miRNAs are also important mediators of nerve regeneration, however, the affected signaling mechanisms are not clearly understood. In the present study, we show that nerve injury-induced miR-431 stimulates regenerative axon growth by silencing Kremen1, an antagonist of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Both the gain-of-function of miR-431 and knockdown of Kremen1 significantly enhance axon outgrowth in murine dorsal root ganglion neuronal cultures. Using cross-linking with AGO-2 immunoprecipitation, and 3'-untranslated region (UTR) luciferase reporter assay we demonstrate miR-431 direct interaction on the 3'-UTR of Kremen1 mRNA. Together, our results identify miR-431 as an important regulator of axonal regeneration and a promising therapeutic target.

24168656	Title	microRNA-122 down-regulation may play a role in severe myocardial fibrosis in human aortic stenosis through TGF-β1 up-regulation.
24168656	Abstract	miRNAs (microRNAs) have been shown to play a role in myocardial fibrosis. The present study was designed to analyse whether alterations in miRNA expression contribute to the progression of myocardial fibrosis in AS (aortic valve stenosis) patients through up-regulation of the pro-fibrotic factor TGF-β1 (transforming growth factor-β type 1). Endomyocardial biopsies were obtained from 28 patients with severe AS, and from the necropsies of 10 control subjects. AS patients presented increased myocardial CVF (collagen volume fraction) and TGF-β1 compared with the controls, these parameters being correlated in all patients. Patients were divided into two groups by cluster analysis according to their CVF: SF (severe fibrosis; CVF >15%; n=15) and non-SF (CVF ≤15%; n=13). TGF-β1 was increased in patients with SF compared with those with non-SF. To analyse the involvement of miRNAs in SF, the miRNA expression profile of 10 patients (four with non-SF and six with SF) was analysed showing that 99 miRNAs were down-regulated and 19 up-regulated in the SF patients compared with the non-SF patients. Those miRNAs potentially targeting TGF-β1 were validated by real-time RT (reverse transcription)-PCR in the whole test population, corroborating that miR-122 and miR-18b were down-regulated in patients with SF compared with those with non-SF and the control subjects. Additionally, miR-122 was inversely correlated with the CVF, TGF-β1 and the TGF-β1-regulated PCPE-1 (procollagen C-terminal proteinase enhancer-1) in all patients. Experiments in human fibroblasts demonstrated that miR-122 targets and inhibits TGF-β1. In conclusion, for the first time we show that myocardial down-regulation of miR-122 might be involved in myocardial fibrosis in AS patients, probably through TGF-β1 up-regulation.

24169343	Title	Direct targeting of SUZ12/ROCK2 by miR-200b/c inhibits cholangiocarcinoma tumourigenesis and metastasis.
24169343	Abstract	The multidrug resistance and distant metastasis of cholangiocarcinoma result in high postoperative recurrence and low long-term survival rates. It has been demonstrated that the ectopic expression of miR-200 suppresses the multidrug resistance and metastasis of cancer. However, the expression and function of miR-200 in cholangiocarcinoma has not yet been described. In this study, we identified dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs, miR) in cholangiocarcinoma tissue by microarray analysis, and subsequent real-time PCR and northern blot analyses validated the expression of candidate miR. We performed functional analyses and investigated the relationship between miR-200b/c expression and the properties of cholangiocarcinoma cells. A dual luciferase assay was applied to examine the effect of miRNAs on the 3'-UTR of target genes, and we demonstrated the function of the target gene by siRNA transfection identifying the downstream pathway via western blotting. We found significantly downregulated expression of four miR-200 family members (miR-200a/b/c/429) and then confirmed that ectopic miR-200b/200c inhibits the migration and invasion of cholangiocarcinoma cells both in vitro and in vivo. We found that miR-200b/c influenced the tumourigenesis of cholangiocarcinoma cells including their tumour-initiating capacity, sphere formation, and drug resistance. We further found that miR-200b/c regulated migration and invasion capacities by directly targeting rho-kinase 2 and regulated tumorigenic properties by directly targeting SUZ12 (a subunit of a polycomb repressor complex). Our study shows that miR-200b/c has a critical role in the regulation of the tumorigenic and metastatic capacity of cholangiocarcinoma and reveals the probable underlying mechanisms.

24169356	Title	MiR-125b acts as an oncogene in glioblastoma cells and inhibits cell apoptosis through p53 and p38MAPK-independent pathways.
24169356	Abstract	We have recently identified miR-125b upregulation in glioblastoma (GMB). The aim of this study is to determine the correlation between miR-125b expression and malignant grades of glioma and the genes targeted by miR-125b. Real-time PCR was employed to measure the expression level of miR-125b. Cell viability was evaluated by cell growth and colony formation in soft-agar assays. Cell apoptosis was determined by Hoechst 33342 staining and AnnexinV-FITC assay. The Luciferase assay was used to confirm the actual binding sites of p38MAPK mRNA. Western blot was used to detect the gene expression level. The expression level of miR-125b is positively correlated with the malignant grade of glioma. Ectopic expression of miR-125b promotes the proliferation of GMB cells. Knockdown of endogenous miR-125b inhibits cell proliferation and promotes cell apoptosis. Further studies reveal that p53 is regulated by miR-125b. However, downregulation of the endogenous miR-125b also results in p53-independent apoptotic pathway leading to apoptosis in p53 mutated U251 cells and p53 knockdown U87 cells. Moreover, p38MAPK is also regulated by miR-125b and downregulation of miR-125b activates the p38MAPK-induced mitochondria apoptotic pathway. High-level expression of miR-125b is associated with poor outcomes of GMB. MiR-125b may have an oncogenic role in GMB cells by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis.

24169524	Title	Allele-specific regulation of DISC1 expression by miR-135b-5p.
24169524	Abstract	Disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) gene has been established as a risk factor for various neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Both coding and regulatory variants in DISC1 have been identified and associated with these phenotypes in genetic studies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of protein coding genes. Since the miRNA-mRNA target recognition mechanism is vulnerable to disruption by DNA polymorphisms, we investigated whether polymorphisms in the DISC1 3'UTR affect binding of miRNAs and lead to allele-specific regulation of DISC1. We identified four predicted polymorphic miRNA target sites in the DISC1 3'UTR, and demonstrated that miR-135b-5p regulates the level of DISC1 mRNA. Moreover, DISC1 regulation by miR-135b-5p is allele specific: miR-135b-5p only binds to the major allele (A) of rs11122396, not to the minor allele (G). Thus, the G allele may be functionally related to the DISC1-associated phenotypes by abolishing regulation by miR-135b-5p, leading to elevated DISC1 levels.

24170200	Title	miR-9 targets CXCR4 and functions as a potential tumor suppressor in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
24170200	Abstract	MicroRNA deregulation and pathway alterations have been implicated in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a highly invasive and metastatic cancer widely prevalent in Southern China. In this study, we report that miR-9 is commonly downregulated in NPC specimens and NPC cell lines with important functional consequences. The reduced expression of miR-9 was inversely correlated with clinical stages and marked the progression from locoregional to metastatic tumors. The CpG island hypermethylation contributed to miR-9 silencing in NPC cell lines and tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-9 dramatically inhibited the proliferative, migratory and invasive capacities of NPC cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that miR-9 strongly reduced the expression of CXCR4 in NPC cells. Luciferase assay demonstrated that miR-9 could directly bind to the 3' untranslated region of CXCR4. Similar to the restoring miR-9 expression, CXCR4 downregulation inhibited cell growth, migration and invasion, whereas CXCR4 overexpression rescued the suppressive effect of miR-9. Mechanistic investigations revealed that CXCR4 functionally mediated the SDF-1-stimulated activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in NPC cells with miR-9 downregulation or CXCR4 overexpression. In clinical specimens, CXCR4 and phospho-p38 were widely overexpressed, and the levels increased with the progression from locoregional to metastatic tumors in NPC tissues. The levels of CXCR4 were inversely correlated with miR-9 or phospho-p38 expression. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-9 functions as a tumor-suppressive microRNA in NPC, and that its suppressive effects are mediated chiefly by repressing CXCR4 expression.

24171926	Title	Down-regulation of miR-138 promotes colorectal cancer metastasis via directly targeting TWIST2.
24171926	Abstract	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common digestive system malignancy. The molecular events involved in the development and progression of CRC remain unclear. Recently, more and more evidences have showed that deregulated miRNAs participate in colorectal carcinogenesis. The expression levels of miR-138 were first examined in CRC cell lines and tumor tissues by real-time PCR. The in vitro and in vivo functional effects of miR-138 were examined further. Luciferase reporter assays were conducted to confirm the targeting associations. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests were performed to estimate the overall survival and disease free survival rate. miR-138 was found to be down-regulated in human colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines. Ectopic expression of miR-138 resulted in a dramatic inhibition of CRC migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Twist basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor 2 gene (TWIST2) was identified as one of the functional target. Restoration of miR-138 resulted in a dramatic reduction of the expression of TWIST2 at both mRNA and protein levels by directly targeting its 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR). Up-regulation of TWIST2 was detected in CRC tumors compared with adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.001) and is inversely correlated with miR-138 expression. We also identified that down-regulation of miR-138 was associated with lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, and always predicted poor prognosis. These data highlight a pivotal role for miR-138 in the regulation of CRC metastasis by targeting TWIST2, and suggest a potential application of miR-138 in prognosis prediction and CRC treatment.

24172884	Title	Androgen receptor decreases CMYC and KRAS expression by upregulating let-7a expression in ER-, PR-, AR+ breast cancer.
24172884	Abstract	It is generally known that the decision to use anti-estrogen therapy is based on the expression of estrogen and progesterone receptors in breast cancers. Recent studies have shown that androgen receptor (AR) is frequently expressed in ER-, PR- breast cancer and plays an important role in the prognosis of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, AR can increase the global expression of microRNAs, post-transcriptional gene regulators that play a crucial role in the initiation and progression of breast cancer. In this study, we investigated the functions and relations of AR, related miRNAs and target proteins in ER-, PR-, AR+ breast cancer. The results showed that androgen-induced AR activating signal directly upregulates let-7a expression, downregulates CMYC and KRAS protein expression, and inhibits cell proliferation in ER-, PR-, AR+ breast cancer cells. Overexpression of let-7a inhibits cell proliferation and downregulates CMYC and KRAS protein expression, whereas inhibition of let-7a expression by specific antisense oligonucleo-tides increases cell growth and upregulates CMYC and KRAS protein expression. We performed in situ hybridization for let-7a and immunohistochemical staining for CMYC and KRAS using sequential sections obtained from surgically-resected breast cancer tissues and observed an inverse correlation between the staining pattern of let-7a and its target proteins. Androgen-induced AR activating signal upregulates let-7a that targets CMYC and KRAS and contributes to ER-, PR-, AR+ breast cancer pathogenesis. Elucidation of this pathway will help develop new therapies.

24172907	Title	Ovine herpesvirus-2-encoded microRNAs target virus genes involved in virus latency.
24172907	Abstract	Herpesviruses encode microRNAs (miRNAs) that target both virus and host genes; however, their role in herpesvirus biology is understood poorly. We identified previously eight miRNAs encoded by ovine herpesvirus-2 (OvHV-2), the causative agent of malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), and have now investigated the role of these miRNAs in regulating expression of OvHV-2 genes that play important roles in virus biology. ORF20 (cell cycle inhibition), ORF50 (reactivation) and ORF73 (latency maintenance) each contain predicted targets for several OvHV-2 miRNAs. Co-transfection of miRNA mimics with luciferase reporter constructs containing the predicted targets showed the 5' UTRs of ORF20 and ORF73 contain functional targets for ovhv-miR-2 and ovhv2-miR-8, respectively, and the 3' UTR of ORF50 contains a functional target for ovhv2-miR-5. Transfection of BJ1035 cells (an OvHV-2-infected bovine T-cell line) with the relevant miRNA mimic resulted in a significant decrease in ORF50 and a smaller but non-significant decrease in ORF20. However, we were unable to demonstrate a decrease in ORF73. MCF is a disease of dysregulated lymphocyte proliferation; miRNA inhibition of ORF20 expression may play a role in this aberrant lymphocyte proliferation. The proteins encoded by ORF50 and ORF73 play opposing roles in latency. It has been hypothesized that miRNA-induced inhibition of virus genes acts to ensure that fluctuations in virus mRNA levels do not result in reactivation under conditions that are unfavourable for viral replication and our data supported this hypothesis.

However, miRNA transcriptionally controlled by Nrf2 had been uncharacterized. Here we report that miR-125b is transactivated by Nrf2 and inhibits aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) repressor (AhRR). Bioinformatic approaches enabled us to extract six candidate miRNAs. Of them, only miR-125b was increased in the kidney of mice treated with oltipraz. Nrf2 overexpression enhanced primary, precursor and mature miR-125b levels. Functional assays revealed MIR125B1 is a bona fide target gene of Nrf2. Oltipraz treatment protected the kidney from cisplatin toxicity with increase of miR-125b. Consistently, Nrf2 knockout abrogated an adaptive increase of miR-125b elicited by cisplatin, augmenting kidney injury. An integrative network of miRNA and messenger RNA changes enabled us to predict miR-125b as an inhibitor of AhRR for the control of AhR activity and cell survival. In our molecular study, miR-125b inhibited AhRR and thereby activated AhR, leading to the induction of mdm2. Consistently, p53 activation by cisplatin was diminished by either miR-125b or oltipraz treatment. The results of experiments using miR-125b mimic or small interfering RNA of AhRR verified the role of miR-125b in AhRR regulation for kidney protection. In conclusion, miR-125b is transcriptionally activated by Nrf2 and serves as an inhibitor of AhRR, which contributes to protecting kidney from acute injury.

24177325	Title	MicroRNA miR-27b rescues bone marrow-derived angiogenic cell function and accelerates wound healing in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
24177325	Abstract	Vascular precursor cells with angiogenic potentials are important for tissue repair, which is impaired in diabetes mellitus. MicroRNAs are recently discovered key regulators of gene expression, but their role in vascular precursor cell-mediated angiogenesis in diabetes mellitus is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that the microRNA miR-27b rescues impaired bone marrow-derived angiogenic cell (BMAC) function in vitro and in vivo in type 2 diabetic mice. BMACs from adult male type 2 diabetic db/db and from normal littermate db/+ mice were used. miR-27b expression was decreased in db/db BMACs. miR-27b mimic improved db/db BMAC function, including proliferation, adhesion, tube formation, and delayed apoptosis, but it did not affect migration. Elevated thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) protein in db/db BMACs was suppressed on miR-27b mimic transfection. Inhibition of miR-27b in db/+ BMACs reduced angiogenesis, which was reversed by TSP-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA). miR-27b suppressed the pro-oxidant protein p66(shc) and mitochondrial oxidative stress, contributing to its protection of BMAC function. miR-27b also suppressed semaphorin 6A to improve BMAC function in diabetes mellitus. Luciferase binding assay suggested that miR-27b directly targeted TSP-1, TSP-2, p66(shc), and semaphorin 6A. miR-27b improved topical cell therapy of diabetic BMACs on diabetic skin wound closure, with a concomitant augmentation of wound perfusion and capillary formation. Normal BMAC therapy with miR-27b inhibition demonstrated reduced efficacy in wound closure, perfusion, and capillary formation. Local miR-27b delivery partly improved wound healing in diabetic mice. miR-27b rescues impaired BMAC angiogenesis via TSP-1 suppression, semaphorin 6A expression, and p66shc-dependent mitochondrial oxidative stress and improves BMAC therapy in wound healing in type 2 diabetic mice.

24178239	Title	NF-κB-mediated miR-30b regulation in cardiomyocytes cell death by targeting Bcl-2.
24178239	Abstract	Angiotensin II(Ang II)-stimulated cardiomyocytes hypertrophy and apoptosis are associated with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation. NF-κB, a redox-sensitive transcription factor, contributes a critical role in cell death, but, Ang II-stimulated NF-κB-mediated cardiomyocytes apoptosis remains less understood. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to be critical regulators in various cardiac remodeling processes; however, NF-κB-mediated miRNA's role in cardiomyocytes apoptosis remains undetermined. The miR-30b has been implicated in diverse cardiac remodeling; but, NF-κB-mediated miR-30b modulation in Ang II-induced cardiomyocytes death is currently unknown. In the present study, neonatal cardiomyocytes were pretreated with SN50, a selective cell permeable peptide inhibitor of NF-κB, or transfected with miR-30b mimetic and inhibitors separately, and then challenged with Ang II. The target gene, Bcl-2, and NF-κB transcriptional activity were analyzed. Our results demonstrated that NF-κB positively regulated miR-30b expression in Ang II-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis, and Bcl-2 was a direct target for miR-30b. NF-κB further regulated the expression of Bcl-2 in the above setting. Furthermore, Ang II-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis rescued by inhibiting either NF-κB or miR-30b provided an important role in cardiomyocytes cell death. We evaluated a critical role of NF-κB-mediated miR-30b modulation in Ang II-stimulated cardiomyocytes targeting Bcl-2. Our data may provide a new insight of miR-30b's role in myocardial infarction or ischemia.

24179536	Title	MicroRNA-373 is upregulated and targets TNFAIP1 in human gastric cancer, contributing to tumorigenesis.
24179536	Abstract	The role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating gene expression is currently an area of intense interest. Previous studies have shown that miRNA-372 plays crucial roles in gastric tumorigenesis by targeting the mRNA of tumor necrosis factor, Alpha-induced protein 1 (TNFAIP1). The present study showed that miR-373 is upregulated in gastric adenocarcinoma tissue and gastric carcinoma cell lines when compared to normal gastric tissues. The overexpression of miR-373 in the gastric cancer cells increased cell proliferation. A bioinformatics search revealed a conserved target site within the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of TNFAIP1, an immediate-early response gene of the endothelium induced by TNF-Alpha. The overexpression of miR-373 caused the suppression of a luciferase reporter containing the TNFAIP1 3'UTR in the HEK293 cells and reduced the levels of TNFAIP1 protein in the AGS cells. The mRNA levels of TNFAIP1 in the gastric cancer and normal gastric tissues were negatively correlated with the expression levels of miR-373 in these tissues. Moreover, the knockdown of TNFAIP1 had a similar effect to the overexpression of miR-373. The overexpression of TNFAIP1 may partly rescue the inhibition of proliferation caused by the inhibitor, miR-373-ASO. Taken together, these findings demonstrate an oncogenic role for miR-373, similar to that of miR-372, in controlling cell growth through the downregulation of TNFAIP1.

24180482	Title	MicroRNA-124-3p inhibits cell migration and invasion in bladder cancer cells by targeting ROCK1.
24180482	Abstract	Increasing evidence has suggested that dysregulation of certain microRNAs (miRNAs) may contribute to human disease including carcinogenesis and tumor metastasis in human. miR-124-3p is down-regulated in various cancers, and modulates proliferation and aggressiveness of cancer cells. However, the roles of miR-124-3p in human bladder cancer are elusive. Thus, this study was conducted to investigate the biological functions and its molecular mechanisms of miR-124-3p in human bladder cancer cell lines, discussing whether it has a potential to be a therapeutic biomarker of bladder cancer. Three human bladder cancer cell lines and samples from ten patients with bladder cancer were analyzed for the expression of miR-124-3p by quantitative RT--PCR. Exogenetic overexpression of miR-124-3p was established by transfecting mimics into T24, UM-UC-3 and J82 cells, after that cell proliferation and cell cycle were assessed by MTT assay, flow cytometry and Colony-forming assay. Cell motility and invasion ability were evaluated by wound healing assay and transwell assay. Tissue microarray, and immunohistochemistry with antibodies against ROCK1, MMP2 and MMP9 was performed using the peroxidase and DAB methods. The target gene of miR-124-3p was determined by luciferase assays, quantitative RT--PCR and western blot. The regulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by miR-124-3p was analyzed by western blot. miR-124-3p is frequently down-regulated in bladder cancer both in three bladder cancer cell lines, T24, UM-UC-3, J82 and clinical samples. Overexpression of miR-124-3p induced G1-phase arrest in T24, UM-UC-3 and J82 cell lines and suppressed cell growth in colony-forming assay. miR-124-3p significantly repressed the capability of migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells. In addition, ROCK1 was identified as a new target of miR-124-3p. ROCK1, MMP2, MMP9 were up-regulated in bladder cancer tissues. Furthermore, we demonstrated miR-124-3p could inhibit bladder cancer cell epithelial mesenchymal transfer, and regulated the expression of c-Met, MMP2, MMP9. miR-124-3p can repress the migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells via regulating ROCK1. Our data indicate that miR-124-3p could be a tumor suppressor and may have a potential to be a diagnostics or predictive biomarker in bladder cancer.

24183204	Title	miR-184 functions as an oncogenic regulator in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
24183204	Abstract	Dysregulation of miRNAs has been proved to play a key role in carcinogenesis or tumor progression. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a number of miRNAs was reported to be related to the occurrence and development of HCC. Especially, miRNA-122, a liver-specific miRNA, has been elaborated its role in HCC. However, these studies was not involved in the effect of miRNA-184 on HCC. In the present study, we aimed to detect the miRNA-184 expression in HCC tissues and further evaluate the in vitro effect of miR-184 inhibition in HCC cells HepG2. We found that miR-184 expression was significantly high in HCC tissues, but INPPL1 expression was obviously low. Subsequently, INPPL1 was identified as a target of miRNA-184 by bioinformatics and dual luciferase assay. Moreover, after transfected with anti-miR-184 in HepG2 cells, INPPL1 expression was significantly decreased both at mRNA and protein levels. Additionally, we also proved that miR-184 silencing inhibited cellular proliferation by over expressing INPPL1 and induced HepG2 apoptosis by caspase 3/7. Together, our result was shown that miR-184 might play a part in proliferation of HCC cells by INPPL1 loss and act as antiapoptotic factor in the development of HCC by inhibiting the activities of caspases 3/7. Therefore, further elucidation of miRNA-184 silencing is helpful for understanding the pathogenesis of HCC and devising new strategies for its prevention and therapy.

24204560	Title	MicroRNA-200c modulates the expression of MUC4 and MUC16 by directly targeting their coding sequences in human pancreatic cancer.
24204560	Abstract	Transmembrane mucins, MUC4 and MUC16 are associated with tumor progression and metastatic potential in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma. We discovered that miR-200c interacts with specific sequences within the coding sequence of MUC4 and MUC16 mRNAs, and evaluated the regulatory nature of this association. Pancreatic cancer cell lines S2.028 and T3M-4 transfected with miR-200c showed a 4.18 and 8.50 fold down regulation of MUC4 mRNA, and 4.68 and 4.82 fold down regulation of MUC16 mRNA compared to mock-transfected cells, respectively. A significant reduction of glycoprotein expression was also observed. These results indicate that miR-200c overexpression regulates MUC4 and MUC16 mucins in pancreatic cancer cells by directly targeting the mRNA coding sequence of each, resulting in reduced levels of MUC4 and MUC16 mRNA and protein. These data suggest that, in addition to regulating proteins that modulate EMT, miR-200c influences expression of cell surface mucins in pancreatic cancer.

24204738	Title	Tumor-suppressive function of miR-139-5p in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
24204738	Abstract	Recent studies have demonstrated the possible function of miR-139-5p in tumorigenesis. However, the exact mechanism of miR-139-5p in cancer remains unclear. In this study, the association of miR-139-5p expression with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) was evaluated in 106 pairs of esophageal cancer and adjacent non-cancerous tissue from ESCC patients. The tumor suppressive features of miR-139-5p were measured by evaluating cell proliferation and cell cycle state, migratory activity and invasion capability, as well as apoptosis. Luciferase reporter assay and Western blot analysis were performed to determine the target gene regulated by miR-139-5p. The mRNA level of NR5A2, the target gene of miR-139-5p, was determined in ESCC patients. Results showed that reduced miR-139-5p level was associated with lymph node metastases of ESCC. MiR-139-5p was investigated to induce cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and to suppress the invasive capability of esophageal carcinoma cells by targeting the 3'UTR of oncogenic NR5A2. Cyclin E1 and MMP9 were confirmed to participate in cell cycle arrest and invasive suppression induced by NR5A2, respectively. Pearson correlation analysis further confirmed the significantly negative correlation between miR-139-5p and NR5A2 expression. The results suggest that miR-139-5p exerts a growth- and invasiveness-suppressing function in human ESCCs, which demonstrates that miR-139-5p is a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and prognosis and is a therapeutic target for ESCC.

24205206	Title	MiR-200c increases the radiosensitivity of non-small-cell lung cancer cell line A549 by targeting VEGF-VEGFR2 pathway.
24205206	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to participate in many important cellular processes including radiosensitization. VEGF family, an important regulator of angiogenesis, also plays a crucial role in the regulation of cancer cell radiosensitivity. VEGFR2 mediates the major growth and permeability actions of VEGF in a paracrine/autocrine manner. MiR-200c, at the nexus of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), is predicted to target VEGFR2. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that regulation of VEGFR2 pathway by miR-200c could modulate the radiosensitivity of cancer cells. Bioinformatic analysis, luciferase reporter assays and biochemical assays were carried out to validate VEGFR2 as a direct target of miR-200c. The radiosensitizing effects of miR-200c on A549 cells were determined by clonogenic assays. The downstream regulating mechanism of miR-200c was explored with western blotting assays, FCM, tube formation assays and migration assays. We identified VEGFR2 as a novel target of miR-200c. The ectopic miR-200c increased the radiosensitivity of A549 while miR-200c down-regulation decreased it. Besides, we proved that miR-200c radiosensitized A549 cells by targeting VEGF-VEGFR2 pathway specifically, thus leading to inhibition of its downstream pro-survival signaling transduction and angiogenesis, and serves as a potential target for radiosensitizition research.

24205217	Title	miR-582-5p is upregulated in patients with active tuberculosis and inhibits apoptosis of monocytes by targeting FOXO1.
24205217	Abstract	Macrophage apoptosis is a host innate defense mechanism against tuberculosis (TB). In this study, we found that percentage of apoptotic cells in peripheral blood monocytes from patients with active TB was lower than that from healthy controls (p<0.001). To understand whether microRNAs can modulate apoptosis of monocytes, we investigated differentially expressed microRNAs in patients with active TB. miR-582-5p was mainly expressed in monocytes and was upregulated in patients with active TB. The apoptotic percentage of THP-1 cells transfected with miR-582-5p mimics was significantly lower than those transfected with negative control of microRNA mimics (p<0.001), suggesting that miR-582-5p could inhibit apoptosis of monocytes. To our knowledge, the role of miR-582-5p in regulating apoptosis of monocytes has not been reported so far. Systematic bioinformatics analysis indicated that FOXO1 might be a target gene for miR-582-5p and its 3'UTR contains potential binding sites for miR-582-5p. To determine whether miR-582-5p could influence FOXO1 expression, miR-582-5p mimics or negative control of microRNA mimics were transfected into THP-1 cells. RT-PCR and western blot analysis showed that the miR-582-5p could suppress both FOXO1 mRNA and protein expression. Co-transfection of miR-582-5p and FOXO1 3'UTR-luciferase reporter vector into cells demonstrated that significant decrease in luciferase activity was only found in reporter vector that contained a wild type sequence of FOXO1 3'UTR, suggesting that miR-582-5p could directly target FOXO1. In conclusion, miR-582-5p inhibited apoptosis of monocytes by down-regulating FOXO1 expression and might play an important role in regulating anti-M. tuberculosis directed immune responses.

24209632	Title	miR-29a suppresses growth and invasion of gastric cancer cells in vitro by targeting VEGF-A.
24209632	Abstract	Increasing data shows miR-29a is a key regulator of oncogenic processes. It is significantly down-regulated in some kind of human tumors and possibly functionally linked to cellular proliferation, survival and migration. However, the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we report miR-29a is significantly under-expressed in gastric cancer compared to the healthy donor. The microvessel density is negatively related to miR-29a expression in gastric cancer tissues. The ectopic expression of miR-29a significantly inhibits proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, western blot combined with the luciferase reporter assays demonstrate that vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is direct target of miR-29a. This is the first time miR-29a was found to suppress the tumor microvessel density in gastric cancer by targeting VEGF-A. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-29a is a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer. Restoration of miR-29a in gastric cancer may be a promising therapeutic approach.

24210072	Title	MicroRNA-29a upregulates MMP2 in oral squamous cell carcinoma to promote cancer invasion and anti-apoptosis.
24210072	Abstract	Abnormal microRNA expression is a common and important feature of human malignancies. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), which has been reported in several cancers, plays important roles in cancer progression. However, the microRNA regulatory mechanism on MMP2 expression remains unclear. In this study, we first detected MMP2 and microRNA-29a (miR-29a) expression in oral squamous carcinoma (OSCC) specimens, which showed that MMP2 was higher in OSCC cancer tissues than adjacent tissues but that miR-29a was lower in OSCC cancer tissues than adjacent tissues. Then, we confirmed that miR-29a, which directly targeted 3'-UTR of MMP2 gene, negatively regulated MMP2 expression by miR-29a transfection and luciferase reporter assay. Exogenous overexpression of miR-29a inhibited OSCC cell invasion and anti-apoptosis significantly in vitro. Whereas, knockdown of miR-29a promoted OSCC cell invasion and induced drug-resistance in vitro. This study suggests that miR-29a plays an inhibiting role in the progression of OSCC, which may be a potentially therapeutic approach in the future.

24211739	Title	MicroRNA-101 inhibits human hepatocellular carcinoma progression through EZH2 downregulation and increased cytostatic drug sensitivity.
24211739	Abstract	Oncogene polycomb group protein enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) has been proposed to be a target gene of putative tumor suppressor microRNA-101 (miR-101). The aim of our study was to investigate the functional role of both miR-101 and EZH2 in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). MiR-101 and EZH2 expressions were evaluated in tumor tissues of 99 HCC patients and 7 liver cancer cell lines by real-time PCR. Luciferase reporter assay was employed to validate whether EZH2 represents a target gene of miR-101. The effect of miR-101 on HCC growth as well as programmed cell death was studied in vitro and in vivo. MiR-101 expression was significantly downregulated in most of HCC tissues and all cell lines, whereas EZH2 was significantly overexpressed in most of HCC tissues and all cell lines. There was a negative correlation between expression levels of miR-101 and EZH2. Luciferase assay results confirmed EZH2 as a direct target gene of miR-101, which negatively regulates EZH2 expression in HCC. Ectopic overexpression of miR-101 dramatically repressed proliferation, invasion, colony formation as well as cell cycle progression in vitro and suppressed tumorigenicity in vivo. Furthermore, miR-101 inhibited autophagy and synergized with either doxorubicin or fluorouracil to induce apoptosis in tumor cells. Tumor suppressor miR-101 represses HCC progression through directly targeting EZH2 oncogene and sensitizes liver cancer cells to chemotherapeutic treatment. Our findings provide significant insights into molecular mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis and may have clinical relevance for the development of novel targeted therapies for HCC.

24211747	Title	MiR-26a enhances the radiosensitivity of glioblastoma multiforme cells through targeting of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated.
24211747	Abstract	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is notoriously resistant to radiation, and consequently, new radiosensitizers are urgently needed. MicroRNAs are a class of endogenous gene modulators with emerging roles in DNA repair. We found that overexpression of miR-26a can enhance radiosensitivity and reduce the DNA repair ability of U87 cells. However, knockdown miR-26a in U87 cells could act the converse manner. Mechanistically, this effect is mediated by direct targeting of miR-26a to the 3'UTR of ATM, which leads to reduced ATM levels and consequent inhibition of the homologous recombination repair pathway. These results suggest that miR-26a may act as a new radiosensitizer of GBM.

24216130	Title	MicroRNA-10b overexpression promotes non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation and invasion.
24216130	Abstract	miRNAs are a class of small non-coding RNA molecules that play an important role in the pathogenesis of human diseases through negative regulation of gene expression. Although miRNA-10b (miR-10b) has been implicated in other tumors, its role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is still unknown. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of miR-10b in NSCLC. Expression of miR-10b was analyzed in NSCLC cell line A549 by qRT-PCR. Cell viability was evaluated using Cell Counting Kit (CCK)-8. Cell migration and invasion were evaluated by wound healing assay and transwell assays. Cell cycle and apoptosis analyses were performed. Western blotting was used to predicate the target of miR-10b. The A549 cell line transfected with the miR-10b exhibited significantly increased proliferation, migration, and invasion capacities when compared with the control cells (P < 0.05). Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) may be indirectly targeted by miR-10b during the proliferation increasing of A549 cells. In this study, we found that miR-10b is a tumor enhancer in NSCLC. Thus, miR-10b may represent a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC intervention.

24218337	Title	MicroRNA-143 is downregulated in breast cancer and regulates DNA methyltransferases 3A in breast cancer cells.
24218337	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-protein-coding RNAs that regulate expression of a wide variety of genes including those involved in cancer development. Here, we investigate the role of miR-143 in breast cancer. In this study, we showed that miR-143 was frequently downregulated in 80% of breast carcinoma tissues compared to their adjacent noncancerous tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-143 inhibited proliferation and soft agar colony formation of breast cancer cells and also downregulated DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) expression on both mRNA and protein levels. Restoration of miR-143 expression in breast cancer cells reduces PTEN hypermethylation and increases TNFRSF10C methylation. DNMT3A was demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-143 by luciferase reporter assay. Furthermore, miR-143 expression was observed to be inversely correlated with DNMT3A mRNA and protein expression in breast cancer tissues. Our findings suggest that miR-143 regulates DNMT3A in breast cancer cells. These findings elucidated a tumor-suppressive role of miR-143 in epigenetic aberration of breast cancer, providing a potential development of miRNA-based treatment for breast cancer.

24219032	Title	miR-224 promotion of cell migration and invasion by targeting Homeobox D 10 gene in human hepatocellular carcinoma.
24219032	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that control target gene expression and are implicated in the regulation of diverse cellular pathways. In our previous research, we have demonstrated that miR-224 was overexpressed in liver cancer cells and tissues, which was an important factor in the regulation of cell migration and invasion. This study aimed to further explore the regulatory mechanism of miR-224 in the migration and invasion in liver cancer cells. A luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm that the HOXD10 gene was a direct target of miR-224. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, Transwell migration, and Matrigel invasion assays were performed to clarify the molecular mechanism of miR-224 in the regulation of cell migration and invasion in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). (i) The expression of miR-224 was strongly upregulated in MHHC97H and MHCC97L cells, and its expression level was significantly associated with cell invasive potential. (ii) The HOXD10 gene was confirmed to be a direct target of miR-224. Compared with normal liver tissues and cells, HOXD10 had lower expression in HCC tissues and cells and inversely regulated HCC cell invasion. (iii) miR-224 promoted expression of the tumor invasion-associated proteins p-PAK4 and MMP-9 by directly targeting HOXD10. Our findings suggest a previously undescribed regulatory pathway in which the miR-224/HOXD10/p-PAK4/MMP-9 signaling pathway contributes to the regulation of cell migration and invasion and provides a new biotarget for HCC treatment.

24222951	Title	Overexpression of miR-196b and HOXA10 characterize a poor-prognosis gastric cancer subtype.
24222951	Abstract	To identify molecular biologic differences between two gastric adenocarcinoma subgroups presenting different prognoses through the analysis of microRNA and protein expression. Array technologies were used to generate 1146 microRNAs and 124 proteins expression profiles of samples from 60 patients with gastric cancer. For the integrative analysis, we used established mRNA expression data published in our previous study. Whole mRNA expression levels were acquired from microarray data for 60 identical gastric cancer patients. Two gastric adenocarcinoma subgroups with distinct mRNA expression profiles presented distinctly different prognoses. MicroRNA and protein expression patterns were compared between gastric cancer tissue and normal gastric tissue and between two different prognostic groups. Aberrantly expressed microRNA, associated mRNA, and protein in patients with poor-prognosis gastric cancer were validated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunochemistry in independent patients. We obtained the expression data of 1146 microRNAs and 124 cancer-related proteins. Four microRNAs were aberrantly expressed in the two prognostic groups and in cancer vs non-cancer tissues (P < 0.05). In the poor-prognosis group, miR-196b, miR-135b, and miR-93 were up-regulated and miR-29c* was down-regulated. miR-196b expression positively correlated with Homeobox A10 (HOXA10) expression (r = 0.726, P < 0.001), which was significantly increased in poor-prognosis patients (P < 0.001). Comparing gastric cancer with non-cancer tissues, 46/124 proteins showed differential expression (P < 0.05); COX2 (P < 0.001) and cyclin B1 (P = 0.017) were clearly over-expressed in the poor-prognosis group. Co-activation of miR-196b and HOXA10 characterized a poor-prognosis subgroup of patients with gastric cancer. Elucidation of the biologic function of miR-196b and HOXA10 is warranted.

24223844	Title	MiR-192 directly binds and regulates Dicer1 expression in neuroblastoma.
24223844	Abstract	Neuroblastoma (NB) arises from the embryonic neural crest and is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children under 5 years of age. Reduced expression of Dicer1 has recently been shown to be in correlation with poor prognosis in NB patients. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms that could lead to the down-regulation of Dicer1 in neuroblastoma. We used computational prediction to identify potential miRs down-regulating Dicer1 in neuroblastoma. One of the miRs that were predicted to target Dicer1 was miR-192. We measured the levels of miR-192 in 43 primary tumors using real time PCR. Following the silencing of miR-192, the levels of dicer1 cell viability, cell proliferation and migration capability were analyzed. Multivariate analysis identified miR-192 as an independent prognostic marker for relapse in neuroblastoma patients (p=0.04). We were able to show through a dual luciferase assay and side-directed mutational analysis that miR-192 directly binds the 3' UTR of Dicer1 on positions 1232-1238 and 2282-2288. An increase in cell viability, proliferation and migration rates were evident in NB cells transfected with miR-192-mimic. Yet, there was a significant decrease in proliferation when NB cells were transfected with an miR-192-inhibitor We suggest that miR-192 might be a key player in NB by regulating Dicer1 expression.

24236097	Title	MicroRNA-20a constrains p300-driven myocardial angiogenic transcription by direct targeting of p300.
24236097	Abstract	To characterize downstream effectors of p300 acetyltransferase in the myocardium. Acetyltransferase p300 is a central driver of the hypertrophic response to increased workload, but its biological targets and downstream effectors are incompletely known. Mice expressing a myocyte-restricted transgene encoding acetyltransferase p300, previously shown to develop spontaneous hypertrophy, were observed to undergo robust compensatory blood vessel growth together with increased angiogenic gene expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated binding of p300 to the enhancers of the angiogenic regulators Angpt1 and Egln3. Interestingly, p300 overexpression in vivo was also associated with relative upregulation of several members of the anti-angiogenic miR-17∼92 cluster in vivo. Confirming this finding, both miR-17-3p and miR-20a were upregulated in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes following adenoviral transduction of p300. Relative expression of most members of the 17∼92 cluster was similar in all 4 cardiac chambers and in other organs, however, significant downregulation of miR-17-3p and miR-20a occurred between 1 and 8 months of age in both wt and tg mice. The decline in expression of these microRNAs was associated with increased expression of VEGFA, a validated miR-20a target. In addition, miR-20a was demonstrated to directly repress p300 expression through a consensus binding site in the p300 3'UTR. In vivo transduction of p300 resulted in repression both of p300 and of p300-induced angiogenic transcripts. p300 drives an angiogenic transcription program during hypertrophy that is fine-tuned in part through direct repression of p300 by miR-20a.

24237305	Title	NF-κB mediated miR-21 regulation in cardiomyocytes apoptosis under oxidative stress.
24237305	Abstract	Oxidative stress, defined as an excess production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is shown to play an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiac remodeling including cell death and contractile dysfunction. Therefore, the balance between ROS production and removal of excess ROS is essential in maintaining the redox state and homeostasis balance in the cell. The increased ROS further activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a redox-sensitive transcription factor and promotes cell death. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as critical regulators of various pathophysiological processes of cardiac remodeling; however, NF-κB-mediated miRNA's role in cardiomyocytes under oxidative stress remains undetermined. The miR-21 has been implicated in diverse cardiac remodeling; but, NF-κB-mediated miR-21 modulation in oxidative stress is currently unknown. Neonatal cardiomyocytes were transfected with IκBα mutant, miR-21 mimetic, and inhibitors separately, and were challenged with H2O2. The target gene, programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), ROS activity, and NF-κB translocation were analyzed. Our results indicated that NF-κB positively regulated miR-21 expression under oxidative stress, and PDCD4 was a direct target for miR-21. NF-κB further regulated the expression of PDCD4 in H2O2-induced oxidative stress. Moreover, H2O2-induced ROS activity and cardiomyocytes apoptosis were partly protected by overexpression of miR-21 and displayed an important role in ROS-mediated cardiomyocytes injury. We evaluated a critical role of NF-κB-mediated miR-21 modulation in H2O2-induced oxidative stress in cardiomyocytes by targeting PDCD4. Our data may provide a new insight of miR-21's role in cardiac diseases primarily mediated by ROS.

24238035	Title	MiR-27 orchestrates the transcriptional regulation of brown adipogenesis.
24238035	Abstract	Brown adipose tissue (BAT) produces heat using chemical energy of lipids and glucose, a function induced by cold exposure or diet. The brown adipogenesis is tightly controlled in a coordinated interplay between several transcriptional factors. It is not known what enables and coordinates this robust program of concerted cooperation between the transcriptional factors and co-regulators necessary for the brown adipogenesis. A. In vivo studies--we investigated the expression levels of miR-27a and b in mice after cold exposure. B. Using gene expression and functional studies together with high throughput imaging in primary preadipocytes, and cell culture models, we investigated the role of miR-27 in beige and brown adipogenesis. C. Using gene silencing and rescue experiments we dissected the molecular mechanisms of the miR-27 action. After cold exposure, miR-27 is downregulated in BAT and subcutaneous white adipose tissue (SAT). MiR-27 is also downregulated during brown adipogenesis of primary preadipocytes in vitro, and it directly targets and negatively regulates the essential components of the brown transcriptional network: Prdm16, Pparα, Creb, and in part Pgc1β. Together with its direct effect on Pparγ, and indirect on Pgc1α, mir-27 decreases brown differentiation of cultured cells and of primary SAT preadipocytes. Our results point to miR-27 as a central upstream regulator of the transcriptional network involved in beige and brown adipogenesis after cold exposure, and suggest miR-27 inhibition as a novel therapeutic approach for metabolic diseases aiming at increasing the beige/brown fat mass.

24240684	Title	Protumorigenic effects of mir-145 loss in malignant pleural mesothelioma.
24240684	Abstract	We identified a discrete number of microRNAs differentially expressed in benign or malignant mesothelial tissues. We focused on mir-145 whose levels were significantly downregulated in malignant mesothelial tissues and malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cell lines as compared to benign tissues (pleura, peritoneum or cysts). We show that promoter hyper-methylation caused very low levels in MPM cell lines and specimens. Treatment of MPM cell lines with mir-145 agonists negatively modulated some protumorigenic properties of MPM cells, such as clonogenicity, cell migration and resistance to pemetrexed treatment. The main effector mechanism of the clonogenic death induced by mir-145 was that of accelerated senescence. We found that mir-145 targeted OCT4 via specific binding to its 3'-UTR. Increased intracellular levels of mir-145 decreased the levels of OCT4 and its target gene ZEB1, thereby counteracting the increase of OCT4 induced by pemetrexed treatment which is known to favor the development of chemoresistant cells. In line with this, reintroduction of OCT4 into mimic-145 treated cells counteracted the effects on clonogenicity and replicative senescence. This further supports the relevance of the mir-145-OCT4 interaction for the survival of MPM cells. The potential use of mir-145 expression levels to classify benign vs malignant mesothelial tissues and the differences between pemetrexed-induced senescence and that induced by the re-expression of mir-145 are discussed.

24244526	Title	MicroRNA-142 reduces monoamine oxidase A expression and activity in neuronal cells by downregulating SIRT1.
24244526	Abstract	Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRs) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative disorders. In HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), miR-142 was found to be upregulated in neurons and myeloid cells in the brain. We investigated the downstream effects of chronic miR-142 upregulation in neuronal cells by comparing gene expression in stable clones of the human neuroblastoma cell line BE(2)M17 expressing miR-142 to controls. Microarray analysis revealed that miR-142 expression led to a reduction in monoamine oxidase (MAO) A mRNA, which was validated by qRT-PCR. In addition to the mRNA, the MAOA protein level and enzyme activity were also reduced. Examination of primary human neurons revealed that miR-142 expression indeed resulted in a downregulation of MAOA protein level. Although MAOA is not a direct target of miR-142, SIRT1, a key transcriptional upregulator of MAOA is, thus miR-142 downregulation of MAOA expression is indirect. MiR-142 induced decrease in MAOA expression and activity may contribute to the changes in dopaminergic neurotransmission reported in HAND.

24244539	Title	miR-122 regulates tumorigenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting AKT3.
24244539	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the orchestration of diverse cellular processes including differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis and are believed to play pivotal roles as oncogenes and tumor suppressors. miR-122, a liver specific miRNA, is significantly down-regulated in most hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) but its role in tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. Here we identify AKT3 as a novel and direct target of miR-122. Restoration of miR-122 expression in HCC cell lines decreases AKT3 levels, inhibits cell migration and proliferation, and induces apoptosis. These anti-tumor phenotypes can be rescued by reconstitution of AKT3 expression indicating the essential role of AKT3 in miR-122 mediated HCC transformation. In vivo, restoration of miR-122 completely inhibited xenograft growth of HCC tumor in mice. Our data strongly suggest that miR-122 is a tumor suppressor that targets AKT3 to regulate tumorigenesis in HCCs and a potential therapeutic candidate for liver cancer.

24244701	Title	The miR-1-NOTCH3-Asef pathway is important for colorectal tumor cell migration.
24244701	Abstract	The tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is mutated in sporadic and familial colorectal tumors. APC stimulates the activity of the Cdc42- and Rac1-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor Asef and promotes the migration and invasion of colorectal tumor cells. Furthermore, Asef is overexpressed in colorectal tumors and is required for colorectal tumorigenesis. It is also known that NOTCH signaling plays critical roles in colorectal tumorigenesis and fate determination of intestinal progenitor cells. Here we show that NOTCH3 up-regulates Asef expression by activating the Asef promoter in colorectal tumor cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that microRNA-1 (miR-1) is down-regulated in colorectal tumors and that miR-1 has the potential to suppress NOTCH3 expression through direct binding to its 3'-UTR region. These results suggest that the miR-1-NOTCH3-Asef pathway is important for colorectal tumor cell migration and may be a promising molecular target for the treatment of colorectal tumors.

24248414	Title	miR-449a Regulates proliferation and chemosensitivity to cisplatin by targeting cyclin D1 and BCL2 in SGC7901 cells.
24248414	Abstract	Recently, several miRNAs have been determined as tumor suppressors in various cancers, such as microRNA-449a. However, the exact molecular mechanisms underlying miR-449a regulated cell proliferation and chemosensitivity in gastric cancer cells have not been well documented. The present study was designed to test whether miR-449a mediates cell proliferation and chemosensitivity in gastric cancer cells via regulating cyclin D1 and BCL2. In vitro, the ability of cell proliferation and cell viability were measured by MTT assay; cell cycle and cell apoptosis was detected by FCM. qRT-PCR was used to measure the expression of miR-449a. Western blot and real-time PCR assays were used to detect the expression of cyclin D1 and BCL2 in gastric cancer cell line SGC7901. miR-449a expression was downregulated in gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 and human gastric cancer tissues, compared to the gastric epithelial cell line GES-1 and matched non-tumor associated tissues. Upregulation of miR-449a reduced the proliferation of SGC7901 cells. Ectopic expression of miR-449a decreased the percentage of S phase cells, increased the percentage of G1/G0 phase cells and increased the apoptosis induced by cisplatin. Moreover, miR-449a inhibited SGC7901 cells proliferation and enhanced cisplatin chemosensitivity by downregulating expression of BCL2 and cyclin D1, respectively, via directly targeting the 3'-untranslated regions of BCL2 and cyclin D1 mRNA. This is the first report to provide evidence that miR-449a could modulate cell cycle and apoptosis through regulating cyclin D1 and BCL2 expression in SGC7901 cells.

24260067	Title	microRNA-449a functions as a tumor-suppressor in gastric adenocarcinoma by targeting Bcl-2.
24260067	Abstract	microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) may function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. The present study identified that miR-449a was downregulated in human gastric cancer. The overexpression of miR-449a inhibited gastric adenocarcinoma cell growth and promoted cell apoptosis in the MGC-803 and SGC-7901 gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines. Subsequently, Bcl-2 was identified as a potential miR-449a target by bioinformatics analysis. It was also shown that Bcl-2 was negatively regulated by miR-449a at the post-transcriptional level, via a specific target site within the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR), by luciferase reporter assay. The expression of miR-449a induced cell apoptosis, as observed by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling and caspase 3/7 assays, and was rescued by Bcl-2 expression. Therefore, these observations indicate that miR-449a acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting the Bcl-2 gene and that it promotes gastric adenocarcinoma cell apoptosis via Bcl-2. The findings of this study contribute to or current understanding of the functions of miR-449a in gastric adenocarcinoma.

24260215	Title	Downregulation of miR-200a induces EMT phenotypes and CSC-like signatures through targeting the β-catenin pathway in hepatic oval cells.
24260215	Abstract	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can be derived from malignant transformed adult hepatic progenitor cells. However, the regulatory factors and molecular mechanisms underlying the process are not well defined. Our previous microRNA (miRNA) microarray analysis revealed a significant decrease of miR-200a level in F344 rat HCC side population (SP) fraction cells versus their normal counterparts. In the present study, we further investigated the effect of miR-200a on hepatic oval cell (HOC) phenotypes. We first confirmed downregulated miR-200a levels in rat hepatoma cells compared with WB-F344 cells. Next, by lentivirus-mediated loss-of-function studies, we showed that stable knockdown of miR-200a confers a mesenchymal phenotype to WB-F344 cells, including an elongated cell morphology, enhanced cell migration ability and expression of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-representative markers. Concomitantly, several cancer stem cell (CSC)-like traits appeared in these cells, which exhibit enhanced spheroid-forming capacity, express putative hepatic CSC markers and display superior resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs in vitro. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis, luciferase assays and western blot analysis identified β-catenin (CTNNB1) as a direct and functional target of miR-200a. Knockdown of miR-200a partially activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and silencing of β-catenin functionally attenuated anti-miR-200a effects in vitro in WB-F344 cells. At length, in vivo xenograft assay demonstrated the acquisition of tumorigenicity of WB-F344 cells after miR-200a siliencing. Collectively, our findings indicate that miR-200a may function as an important regulatory factor in neoplastic transition of HOCs by targeting the β-catenin pathway.

24265291	Title	miR-320a suppresses colorectal cancer progression by targeting Rac1.
24265291	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as critical epigenetic regulators involved in cancer progression. miR-320a has been identified to be a novel tumour suppressive miRNA in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the detailed molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we reported that miR-320a inversely associated with CRC aggressiveness in both cell lines and clinical specimens. Functional studies demonstrated that miR-320a significantly decreased the capability of cell migration/invasion and induced G0/G1 growth arrest in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Rac1 was identified as one of the direct downstream targets of miR-320a and miR-320a specifically binds to the conserved 8-mer at position 1140-1147 of Rac1 3'-untranslated region to regulate Rac1 protein expression. Over-expression of miR-320a in SW620 cells inhibited Rac1 expression, whereas reduction of miR-320a by anti-miR-320a in SW480 cells enhanced Rac1 expression. Re-expression of Rac1 in the SW620/miR-320a cells restored the cell migration/invasion inhibited by miR-320a, whereas knockdown of Rac1 in the SW480/anti-miR-320a cells repressed these cellular functions elevated by anti-miR-320a. Conclusively, our results demonstrate that miR-320a functions as a tumour-suppressive miRNA through targeting Rac1 in CRC.

24267199	Title	MiR-181a contributes to bufalin-induced apoptosis in PC-3 prostate cancer cells.
24267199	Abstract	Bufalin is a major active compound of cinobufacini, which comes from dried toad venom and has been used for treatments of various cancers in China for many years. A number of studies have demonstrated that bufalin can induce apoptosis in some cancers. However, effects and mechanism of bufalin on prostate cancer cells remain unknown. Apoptosis assay was measured by the annexin-V/PI flow cytometric assay. Western blot was used to measure Caspase-3 and Bcl-2. qRT-PCR was used to measure the relative expression of miR-181a. Bufalin was found to induce the expression of miR-181a, a small non-coding RNA believed to induce apoptosis by repressing its target gene, BCL-2. In prostate cancer PC-3cell line, bufalin-induced apoptosis can be largely attenuated by a miR-181a inhibitor, which blocked bufalin-induced Bcl-2 reduction and caspase-3 activation. Our dataindicatedthat miR-181a mediates bufalin-induced apoptosis in PC-3 cells. Thus, we presented here a new pharmacological mechanism for bufalin in anti-tumor therapy.

We provide insight into the behavior of miR-221 in colorectal cancer (CRC) metastasis by showing that miR-221 is significantly upregulated in metastatic CRC cell lines and tissues. miR-221 overexpression enhances, whereas miR-221 depletion reduces CRC cell migration and invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. We identify RECK as a direct target of miR-221, reveal its expression to be inversely correlated with miR-221 in CRC samples and show that its re-introduction reverses miR-221-induced CRC invasiveness. Collectively, miR-221 is an oncogenic miRNA which may regulate CRC migration and invasion through targeting RECK.

24270883	Title	MicroRNA-203 inhibits the proliferation and invasion of U251 glioblastoma cells by directly targeting PLD2.
24270883	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to be important in the development and progression of various types of cancer. However, the exact roles of certain anti‑oncogenic miRNAs in human malignant gliomas remain to be elucidated. The present study aimed to reveal the expression of microRNA‑203 (miR-203) in normal brain tissues and gliomas, and to investigate the role of miR-203 in cell proliferation and migration in human glioblastoma U251 cells. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that the expression of miR-203 in high WHO grade glioma tissues was significantly decreased compared with low WHO grade glioma tissues and normal brain tissues, and its expression demonstrated a decreasing tendency with ascending WHO grades. The transfection of the miR-203 mimic into U251 cells markedly downregulated the expression of phospholipase D2 (PLD2), which was identified as a direct target of miR-203. Furthermore, miR-203 overexpression significantly suppressed the proliferation and invasion of U251 cells, while the overexpression of PLD2 abrogated these effects induced by the miR-203 mimic. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the clinical significance of miR-203 in gliomas and suggested that miR-203 was able to inhibit the proliferation and invasion of glioma cells, partially at least via suppressing the protein expression of PLD2. Thus, miR-203 may be a novel candidate for the development of therapeutic strategies for gliomas.

24276755	Title	miR-141 suppresses proliferation and motility of gastric cancer cells by targeting HDGF.
24276755	Abstract	miR-141 belongs to the miR-200 family, and has been found to be associated with numerous human malignancies; however, its role in gastric cancer (GC) has not been examined in detail. Here, we validated that miR-141 was decreased in GC tissues and cell lines. Forced expression of miR-141 significantly repressed GC cell proliferation and colony formation. Furthermore, miR-141 suppressed in vitro migration and invasion of GC cells. Hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) was confirmed to be a direct target of miR-141 in GC cells. The suppressive effects of miR-141 on GC cell proliferation, colony formation, in vitro migration, and invasion were partially mediated by suppressing HDGF expression. Moreover, the expression of HDGF was negatively correlated with miR-141 in GC tissues. Our data suggest that miR-141 might be associated and plays essential role in GC progression.

24277415	Title	Combined aberrant expression of microRNA-214 and UBC9 is an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for patients with gliomas.
24277415	Abstract	MicroRNA-214 (miR-214) plays an important role in tumor cell proliferation, migration and invasion, as well as tumor angiogenesis. Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (UBC9) is implicated in regulating several critical cancer-related pathways. Recent study has demonstrated that miR-214 reduction may facilitate UBC9 expression and may be involved in the regulation of glioma cell proliferation. The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical significance of miR-214 and UBC9 in human glioma, which has not been fully elucidated. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis was used to characterize the expression patterns of miR-214 and UBC9 mRNA in 108 glioma and 20 normal brain tissues. The associations of miR-214 and UBC9 mRNA expressions with clinicopathological factors and prognosis of glioma patients were also statistically analyzed. Compared with normal brain tissues, the expression levels of miR-214 and UBC9 mRNA in glioma tissues were significantly downregulated and upregulated, respectively (both P < 0.001). There was a negative correlation between miR-214 and UBC9 mRNA expression in glioma tissues (r = -0.61, P = 0.01). Additionally, the combined miR-214 downregulation and UBC9 upregulation (miR-214-low/UBC9-high) was significantly associated with advanced pathological grade (P = 0.008). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses showed that the glioma patients with miR-214-low/UBC9-high expression had poorest overall survival (P < 0.001) and conjoined expression of miR-214-low/UBC9-high was an independent prognostic indicator of glioma (P = 0.01). Furthermore, subgroup analyses showed that miR-214-low/UBC9-high expression was significantly associated with poor overall survival in glioma patients with high pathological grades (for grade III-IV: P < 0.001). This prospective study offers the convincing evidence for the first time that miR-214 and its target gene UBC9 may contribute to the development and the clinical outcome of glioma, and are valuable prognostic factors for glioma patients. A combined detection of miR-214/UBC9 expression may benefit us in predicting the prognosis of patients with advanced gliomas.

24281003	Title	PA28gamma emerges as a novel functional target of tumour suppressor microRNA-7 in non-small-cell lung cancer.
24281003	Abstract	MicroRNA-7 (miR-7) has been reported to be a tumour suppressor gene. However, whether it has a role in the growth of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and what is its target involved in the tumour growth is still under investigation. NSCLC tissue sample, NSCLC cell lines and tissue microarray were investigated in this study. Total RNA, miRNA and protein were used for RT-PCR and western blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed in tissues microarray. Cell culture and intervention experiments were performed in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatics prediction, western blot and luciferase assay were identified the target of miR-7. In this study, we found that the expression of miR-7 was significantly downregulated not only in NSCLC cell lines, but also in human NSCLC tissues compared with the matched adjacent tissues. Restoration of its expression through miR-7 mimics in A549 and H1299 NSCLC cells inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell-cycle progression in vitro. More importantly, the tumorigenicity in nude mice was reduced after administration of miR-7 in vivo. In advance, through bioinformatic analysis, luciferase assay and western blot, we identified a novel target of miR-7, PA28gamma (a proteasome activator) to be enrolled in the regulation with tumour. PA28gamma mRNA and protein levels are markedly upregulated in NSCLC cell lines and tumour samples, exhibiting a strong inverse relation with that of miR-7. In addition, knockdown of PA28gamma induced similar effects as overexpression of miR-7 in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, miR-7 overexpression or silencing of PA28gamma reduced the cyclinD1 expression at mRNA and protein level in NSCLC cell lines. All these findings strongly imply that the overexpression of PA28gamma resulted from miR-7 downexpression in NSCLC has an important role in promoting cancer cell progress and consequently results in NSCLC growth. Thus, strategies targeting PA28gamma and/or miR-7 may become promising molecular therapies in NSCLC treatment.

24283299	Abstract	AAA (abdominal aortic aneurysm) is a potentially life-threatening late-onset degenerative condition. miRNAs (microRNAs), the small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression, have been shown previously to be associated with a broad range of human pathologies, including cardiovascular diseases. The aim of the present study was to identify AAA-associated miRNAs potentially contributing to AAA pathology. We analysed the expression of 124 miRNAs within AAA biopsies and serum of ten patients undergoing AAA repair, and serum from ten age- and sex-matched subjects without AAA, using the FlexmiR™ MicroRNA Assay. RNA extracted from the site of main AAA dilatation (AAA body) was compared with that extracted from the macroscopically non-dilated neck of the AAA (AAA neck). Similarly, RNA extracted from the serum of AAA patients (AAA serum) was compared with that extracted from age- and sex-matched controls (control serum). qPCR (quantitative real-time PCR), Western blot analysis and histology were performed using an independent set of six paired AAA body and neck biopsies to examine the validity of findings. Seven miRNAs were up-regulated [>2-fold difference, FDR (false discovery rate) <0.5] within AAA biopsies, of which miR-155 was the most differentially expressed (11.32-fold, FDR=0.414). This finding was confirmed by qPCR with the median relative expression of miR-155 being 3.26 and 0.63 within AAA body and AAA neck biopsies respectively (P=0.031). Circulating miR-155 was also increased in AAA patients compared with controls, with a 2.67-fold up-regulation at borderline significance (FDR=0.554). Two immunologically important miR-155 target genes, CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein) and SMAD2, were assessed and found to be significantly down-regulated within AAA bodies compared with AAA necks (P=0.032 and P=0.026) as determined by qPCR and Western blotting respectively. Histology demonstrated dense accumulation of T-lymphocytes within the adventitial and outer medial layers of AAA body, but not neck tissue. The results of the present study suggest that miR-155 is overexpressed in AAA with potential implications in the pathogenesis of the condition.

24283360	Title	MicroRNA-143 regulates collagen type III expression in stromal fibroblasts of scirrhous type gastric cancer.
24283360	Abstract	Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide. In particular, scirrhous type GC is highly metastatic and is characterized clinically by rapid disease progression and poor prognosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in cancer development and progression. In the present study, we identified several miRNAs that are expressed at higher levels in scirrhous type GC than in non-scirrhous type GC by miRNA microarray analysis. Among these, microRNA-143 (miR-143) expression was higher in scirrhous type GC than in non-scirrhous types of GC. In situ hybridization and quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that miR-143 is expressed by stromal fibroblasts but not by cancer cells. In stromal cells, miR-143 enhanced collagen type III expression in normal gastric fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts through activation of transforming growth factor-Beta)/SMAD signaling. Furthermore, high miR-143 expression in GC was associated with worse cancer-specific mortality (P = 0.0141). Multivariate analysis revealed that miR-143 was an independent prognostic factor. Treatment of GC cell lines with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored the expression of miR-143, and precursor miR-143 caused the inhibition of cancer cell invasion. These data suggest that miR-143 regulates fibrosis of scirrhous type GC through induction of collagen expression in stromal fibroblasts and that miR-143 expression serves as a prognostic marker of GC.

24283384	Title	MicroRNA-148a is downregulated in gastric cancer, targets MMP7, and indicates tumor invasiveness and poor prognosis.
24283384	Abstract	Gastric cancer (GC) develops through deregulation of gene expression and accumulation of epigenetic abnormalities, leading to tumor cell acquisition of malignant features. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in cancer development where they can act as oncogenes or oncosuppressors. To identify miRNAs that are associated with some clinicopathologic features of GC and/or participate in tumor progression, miRNA expression in 20 GC tissues and five corresponding non-neoplastic gastric mucosa was examined by miRNA microarray. Oligonucleotide array analysis was carried out for miRNA target prediction. The functions of candidate miRNAs and their target genes were also analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting, reporter gene assay, and cell invasion assay. Comparison of miRNA expression profiles revealed that downregulation of miR-148a was identified in most of the GC tissues. Downregulation of miR-148a was significantly correlated with an advanced clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and poor clinical outcome. Custom oligonucleotide array analysis revealed that MMP7 expression was markedly downregulated in miR-148a-overexpressing GC cells; MMP7 was found to be a direct and functional target of miR-148a, participating in cell invasion. These results suggest that miR-148a contributes to the maintenance of homeostasis in normal stomach tissue and plays an important role in GC invasion by regulating MMP7 expression.

24285464	Title	hsa-miR-141 downregulates TM4SF1 to inhibit pancreatic cancer cell invasion and migration.
24285464	Abstract	Expression of the transmembrane-4-L-six-family-1 (TM4SF1) is high in human pancreatic cancer cells, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify and characterize microRNAs that regulate TM4SF1 expression in PC cells. Western blot analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction were used to detect TM4SF1 and hsa-miR-141 levels in four PC cell lines. SW1990 and BxPc-3 cells were transfected with the inhibitor miR-141, the inhibitor negative control, the miR-141 mimic and the mimic negative control; and cell invasion, migration, proliferation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis were detected by Transwell, MTT and flow cytometry assays, respectively. The miR-141 levels negatively correlated with the TM4SF1 protein levels in PC cells. The TM4SF1 protein levels were lower in the 141M group but higher in the 141I group, although the TM4SF1 mRNA levels had no significant changes, compared to the negative controls. Luciferase assays demonstrated that hsa-miR-141 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region of the TM4SF1 gene. In addition, miR-141 downregulated TM4SF1 expression to inhibit invasion and migration of PC cells but had no effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle progression or apoptosis. TM4SF1 is a direct target of miR-141. Our findings that TM4SF1 expression was inhibited by miR-141 provide new insights into the oncogenic mechanism of TM4SF1 and suggest that miR-141 represents a novel molecular target for PC therapy.

24286315	Title	MiR-221 promotes trastuzumab-resistance and metastasis in HER2-positive breast cancers by targeting PTEN.
24286315	Abstract	HER2-overexpressing breast cancers are characterized by frequent distant metastasis and often develop resistance after short-term effective treatment with the monoclonal antibody drug, trastuzumab. Here, we found that the oncogenic miRNA, miR-221, inhibited apoptosis, induced trastuzumab resistance and promoted metastasis of HER2-positive breast cancers. The tumor suppressor PTEN was identified as a miR-221 target; overexpression of PTEN abrogated the aforementioned miR-221-induced malignant phenotypes of the cells. These findings indicate that miR-221 may promote trastuzumab resistance and metastasis of HER2-positive breast cancers by targeting PTEN, suggesting its role as a potential biomarker for progression and poor prognosis, and as a novel target for trastuzumab-combined treatment of breast cancers.

24291638	Title	Regulation of the neuronal transcription factor NPAS4 by REST and microRNAs.
24291638	Abstract	NPAS4 is a brain restricted, activity-induced transcription factor which regulates the expression of inhibitory synapse genes to control homeostatic excitatory/inhibitory balance in neurons. NPAS4 is required for normal social interaction and contextual memory formation in mice. Protein and mRNA expression of NPAS4 is tightly coupled to neuronal depolarization and most prevalent in the cortical and hippocampal regions in the brain, however the precise mechanisms by which the NPAS4 gene is controlled remain unexplored. Here we show that expression of NPAS4 mRNA is actively repressed by RE-1 silencing transcription factor/neuron-restrictive silencer factor (REST/NRSF) in embryonic stem cells and non-neuronal cells by binding multiple sites within the promoter and Intron I of NPAS4. Repression by REST also appears to correlate with the binding of the zinc finger DNA binding protein CTCF within Intron I of NPAS4. In addition, we show that the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of NPAS4 can be targeted by two microRNAs, miR-203 and miR-224 to further regulate its expression. miR-224 is a midbrain/hypothalamus enriched microRNA which is expressed from an intron within the GABAA receptor epsilon (GABRE) gene and may further regionalize NPAS4 expression. Our results reveal REST and microRNA dependent mechanisms that restrict NPAS4 expression to the brain.

24300912	Title	MicroRNA-33 regulates sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 expression in mice.
24300912	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRs) are small non-protein-coding RNAs that bind to specific mRNAs and inhibit translation or promote mRNA degradation. Recent reports have indicated that miR-33, which is located within the intron of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 2, controls cholesterol homoeostasis and may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of atherosclerosis. Here we show that deletion of miR-33 results in marked worsening of high-fat diet-induced obesity and liver steatosis. Using miR-33(-/-)Srebf1(+/-) mice, we demonstrate that SREBP-1 is a target of miR-33 and that the mechanisms leading to obesity and liver steatosis in miR-33(-/-) mice involve enhanced expression of SREBP-1. These results elucidate a novel interaction between SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 mediated by miR-33 in vivo.

24302991	Title	miR-146a enhances the oncogenicity of oral carcinoma by concomitant targeting of the IRAK1, TRAF6 and NUMB genes.
24302991	Abstract	MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are crucial to tumorigenesis. Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent malignancy worldwide. Up-regulation of miR-146 has been identified in OSCC tissues. However, the roles of miR-146 in carcinogenesis are controversial as it is suppressive in many other malignancies. The present study investigated the pathogenic implications of miR-146a in oral carcinogenesis. Microdissected OSCC exhibits higher levels of miR-146a expression than matched adjacent mucosal cells. The plasma miR-146a levels of patients are significantly higher than those of control subjects; these levels decrease drastically after tumor resection. miR-146a levels in tumors and in patients' plasma can be used to classify OSCC and non-disease status (sensitivity: >0.72). Exogenous miR-146a expression is significantly increased in vitro oncogenic phenotypes as well as during xenograft tumorigenesis and OSCC metastasis. The plasma miR-146a levels of these mice parallel the xenograft tumor burdens of the mice. A miR-146a blocker abrogates the growth of xenograft tumors. miR-146a oncogenic activity is associated with down-regulation of IRAK1, TRAF6 and NUMB expression. Furthermore, miR-146a directly targets the 3'UTR of NUMB and a region within the NUMB coding sequence when suppressing NUMB expression. Exogenous NUMB expression attenuates OSCC oncogenicity. Double knockdown of IRAK1 and TRAF6, and of TRAF6 and NUMB, enhance the oncogenic phenotypes of OSCC cells. Oncogenic enhancement modulated by miR-146a expression is attenuated by exogenous IRAK1 or NUMB expression. This study shows that miR-146a expression contributes to oral carcinogenesis by targeting the IRAK1, TRAF6 and NUMB genes.

24304814	Title	miR-223 regulates cell growth and targets proto-oncogenes in mycosis fungoides/cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
24304814	Abstract	The pathogenesis of the cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), mycosis fungoides (MF), is unclear. MicroRNA (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs that target mRNA leading to reduced mRNA translation. Recently, specific miRNA were shown to be altered in CTCL. We detected significantly reduced expression of miR-223 in early-stage MF skin, and further decreased levels of miR-223 in advanced-stage disease. CTCL peripheral blood mononuclear cells and cell lines also had reduced miR-223 as compared with controls. Elevated expression of miR-223 in these cell lines reduced cell growth and clonogenic potential, whereas inhibition of miR-223 increased cell numbers. Investigations into putative miR-223 targets with oncogenic function, including E2F1 and MEF2C, and the predicted miR-223 target, TOX, revealed that all three were targeted by miR-223 in CTCL. E2F1, MEF2C, and TOX proteins were decreased with miR-223 overexpression, whereas miR-223 inhibition led to increased protein levels in CTCL. In addition, we showed that the 3'-UTR of TOX mRNA was a genuine target of miR-223. Therefore, reduced levels of miR-223 in MF/CTCL lead to increased expression of E2F1, MEF2C, and TOX, which likely contributes to the development and/or progression of CTCL. Thus, miR-223 and its targets may be useful for the development of new therapeutics for MF/CTCL.

24305703	Title	MiR-328 promotes glioma cell invasion via SFRP1-dependent Wnt-signaling activation.
24305703	Abstract	Background Diffusely infiltrative growth of human astrocytic gliomas is one of the major obstacles to successful tumor therapy. Thorough insights into the molecules and pathways signaling glioma cell invasion thus appear of major relevance for the development of targeted and individualized therapies. By miRNA expression profiling of microdissected human tumor biopsy specimens we identified miR-328 as one of the main miRNAs upregulated in invading glioma cells in vivo and further investigated its role in glioma pathogenesis. Methods We employed miRNA mimics and inhibitors to functionally characterize miR-328, 3' untranslated region luciferase assays, and T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor reporter assays to pinpoint miR-328 targets and signaling pathways, and analyzed miR-328 expression in a large panel of gliomas. Results First, we corroborated the invasion-promoting role of miR-328 in A172 and TP365MG glioma cells. Secreted Frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1), an inhibitor of Wnt signaling, was then pinpointed as a direct miR-328 target. SFRP1 expression is of prognostic relevance in gliomas with reduced expression, being associated with significantly lower overall patient survival in both the Repository of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) and The Cancer Genome Atlas. Of note, miR-328 regulated both SFRP1 protein expression levels and Wnt signaling pathway activity. Finally, in human glioma tissues miR-328 appeared to account for the downregulation of SFRP1 preferentially in lower-grade astrocytic gliomas and was inversely related to SFRP1 promoter hypermethylation. Conclusion Taken together, we report on a novel molecular miR-328-dependent mechanism that via SFRP1 inhibition and Wnt activation contributes to the infiltrative glioma phenotype at already early stages of glioma progression, with unfavorable prognostic implications for the final outcome of the disease.

24307696	Title	The impact of miRNA-based molecular diagnostics and treatment of NRF2-stabilized tumors.
24307696	Abstract	NF-E2-related factor 2 (NRF2) is a master transcriptional regulator that integrates cellular stress responses and is negatively regulated by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1) at the posttranslational level. In human cancers, aberrantly stabilized NRF2, either by mutation of NRF2 or KEAP1, plays a vital role in chemoresistance and tumor cell growth through the transcriptional activation of target genes, suggesting that targeted inhibition of NRF2 is a potential therapy for NRF2-stabilized tumors. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that can negatively regulate gene expression by interfering with the translation or stability of target transcripts. Moreover, tumor-suppressor miRNAs have been suggested to be useful for cancer treatment. Here, a reporter-coupled miRNA library screen identified four miRNAs (miR-507, -634, -450a, and -129-5p) that negatively regulate the NRF2-mediated oncogenic pathway by directly targeting NRF2. Importantly, downregulation of these miRNAs, in addition to the somatic mutation of NRF2 or KEAP1, is associated with stabilized NRF2 and poor prognosis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Furthermore, administration of a miR-507 alone or in combination with cisplatin inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Thus, these findings reveal that miRNA-based therapy is effective against NRF2-stabilized ESCC tumors. This study determines the potential of miRNA-based molecular diagnostics and therapeutics in NRF2-stablized tumors.

24312276	Title	Down-regulation of miR-126 is associated with colorectal cancer cells proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting IRS-1 via the AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.
24312276	Abstract	Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) play important roles in carcinogenesis. MiR-126 has been shown to be down-regulated in CRC. In this study, we identified the potential effects of miR-126 on some important biological properties of CRC cells and clarified the regulation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and its possible signaling pathway by miR-126. The effect of miR-126 on IRS-1, AKT, and ERK1/2 expression was assessed in the CRC cell lines HT-29 and HCT-116 with a miR-126 mimic or inhibitor to increase or decrease miR-126 expression. Furthermore, the roles of miR-126 in regulation of the biological properties of CRC cells were analyzed with miR-126 mimic or inhibitor-transfected cells. The 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of IRS-1 regulated by miR-126 was analyzed by using a dual-luciferase reporter assay. We found that IRS-1 is the functional downstream target of miR-126 by directly targeting the 3'-UTR of IRS-1. Endogenous miR-126 and exogenous miR-126 mimic inhibited IRS-1 expression. Furthermore, gain-of-function or loss-of-function studies showed that over-expression of miR-126 down-regulated IRS-1, suppressed AKT and ERK1/2 activation, CRC cells proliferation, migration, invasion, and caused cell cycle arrest, but had no effect on cell apoptosis. Knockdown of miR-126 promoted these processes in HCT-116 cells and promoted AKT and ERK1/2 activation by up-regulating the expression of the IRS-1 protein. MiR-126 may play roles in regulation of the biological behavior of CRC cells, at least in part, by targeting IRS-1 via AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways.

24312366	Title	Identification of miR-30e* regulation of Bmi1 expression mediated by tumor-associated macrophages in gastrointestinal cancer.
24312366	Abstract	Bmi1 is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers including gastrointestinal cancer. The high expression level of Bmi1 protein is associated with poor prognosis of gastrointestinal cancer patients. On the other hand, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) contribute to tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis by producing various mediators in the tumor microenvironment. The aim of this study was to investigate TAM-mediated regulation of Bmi1 expression in gastrointestinal cancer. The relationship between TAMs and Bmi1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and results showed a positive correlation with tumor-infiltrating macrophages (CD68 and CD163) and Bmi1 expression in cancer cells. Co-culture with TAMs triggered Bmi1 expression in cancer cell lines and enhanced sphere formation ability. miRNA microarray analysis of a gastric cancer cell line co-cultured with macrophages was conducted, and using in silico methods to analyze the results, we identified miR-30e* as a potential regulator of Bmi1 expression. Luciferase assays using miR-30e* mimic revealed that Bmi1 was a direct target for miR-30e* by interactions with the putative miR-30e* binding sites in the Bmi1 3' untranslated region. qRT-PCR analysis of resected cancer specimens showed that miR-30e* expression was downregulated in tumor regions compared with non-tumor regions, and Bmi1 expression was inversely correlated with miR-30e* expression in gastric cancer tissues, but not in colon cancer tissues. Our findings suggest that TAMs may cause increased Bmi1 expression through miR-30e* suppression, leading to tumor progression. The suppression of Bmi1 expression mediated by TAMs may thus represent a possible strategy as the treatment of gastrointestinal cancer.

24312487	Title	MicroRNA-99 family members suppress Homeobox A1 expression in epithelial cells.
24312487	Abstract	The miR-99 family is one of the evolutionarily most ancient microRNA families, and it plays a critical role in developmental timing and the maintenance of tissue identity. Recent studies, including reports from our group, suggested that the miR-99 family regulates various physiological processes in adult tissues, such as dermal wound healing, and a number of disease processes, including cancer. By combining 5 independent genome-wide expression profiling experiments, we identified a panel of 266 unique transcripts that were down-regulated in epithelial cells transfected with miR-99 family members. A comprehensive bioinformatics analysis using 12 different sequence-based microRNA target prediction algorithms revealed that 81 out of these 266 down-regulated transcripts are potential direct targets for the miR-99 family. Confirmation experiments and functional analyses were performed to further assess 6 selected miR-99 target genes, including mammalian Target of rapamycin (mTOR), Homeobox A1 (HOXA1), CTD small phosphatase-like (CTDSPL), N-myristoyltransferase 1 (NMT1), Transmembrane protein 30A (TMEM30A), and SWI/SNF-related matrix-associated actin-dependent regulator of chromatin subfamily A member 5 (SMARCA5). HOXA1 is a known proto-oncogene, and it also plays an important role in embryonic development. The direct targeting of the miR-99 family to two candidate binding sequences located in the HOXA1 mRNA was confirmed using a luciferase reporter gene assay and a ribonucleoprotein-immunoprecipitation (RIP-IP) assay. Ectopic transfection of miR-99 family reduced the expression of HOXA1, which, in consequence, down-regulated the expression of its downstream gene (i.e., Bcl-2) and led to reduced proliferation and cell migration, as well as enhanced apoptosis. In summary, we identified a number of high-confidence miR-99 family target genes, including proto-oncogene HOXA1, which may play an important role in regulating epithelial cell proliferation and migration during physiological disease processes, such as dermal wound healing and tumorigenesis.

24312495	Title	miR-150 promotes human breast cancer growth and malignant behavior by targeting the pro-apoptotic purinergic P2X7 receptor.
24312495	Abstract	The P2X7 receptor regulates cell growth through mediation of apoptosis. Low level expression of P2X7 has been linked to cancer development because tumor cells harboring a defective P2X7 mechanism can escape P2X7 pro-apoptotic control. microRNAs (miRNAs) function as negative regulators of post-transcriptional gene expression, playing major roles in cellular differentiation, proliferation, and metastasis. In this study, we found that miR-150 was over-expressed in breast cancer cell lines and tissues. In these breast cancer cell lines, blocking the action of miR-150 with inhibitors leads to cell death, while ectopic expression of the miR-150 results in increased cell proliferation. We deploy a microRNA sponge strategy to inhibit miR-150 in vitro, and the result demonstrates that the 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) of P2X7 receptor contains a highly conserved miR-150-binding motif and its direct interaction with miR-150 down-regulates endogenous P2X7 protein levels. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that miR-150 over-expression promotes growth, clonogenicity and reduces apoptosis in breast cancer cells. Meanwhile, these findings can be decapitated in nude mice with breast cancer xenografts. Finally, these observations strengthen our working hypothesis that up-regulation of miR-150 in breast cancer is inversely associated with P2X7 receptor expression level. Together, these findings establish miR-150 as a novel regulator of P2X7 and a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer.

24314023	Title	Mir-655 up-regulation suppresses cell invasion by targeting pituitary tumor-transforming gene-1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
24314023	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can act as either oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes under different conditions and thus can play a significant role in cancer development. We investigated miR-655 expression in a cohort of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) to assess the impact of this miRNA on ESCC cell invasion and metastasis. A qRT-PCR assay was used to quantify miR-655 expression levels in 34 paired ESCC samples and adjacent non-tumor tissues. Wound healing and transwell assays were used to evaluate the effects of miR-655 expression on the invasiveness of ESCC cells. Luciferase reporter and western blot assays were used to determine whether the mRNA encoding pituitary tumor-transforming gene-1 (PTTG1) is a major target of miR-655. The expression level of miR-655 in ESCC tissues was found to be lower than in adjacent non-tumor tissues (P < 0.05). This relatively low expression level was significantly associated with the occurrence of lymph node metastases (P < 0.05). Migration rates were significantly lower for two ESCC-derived cell lines (EC9706 and KYSE150) transfected with miR-429 mimics (P < 0.05). Subsequent western blot and luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-655 could bind to putative binding sites within the PTTG1 mRNA 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) and thus reduce the expression. miR-655 is expressed at low levels in primary ESCC tissues, and up-regulation of miR-655 inhibits ESCC cell invasiveness by targeting PTTG1. Our findings suggest that PTTG1 may act as a major target of miR-655. This study improves our understanding of the mechanisms underlying ESCC pathogenesis and may promote the development of novel targeted therapies.

24315818	Title	Upregulated microRNA-301a in breast cancer promotes tumor metastasis by targeting PTEN and activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling.
24315818	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are strongly implicated in many cancers, including breast cancer. Recently, microRNA-301a (miR-301a) has been proved to play a substantial role in gastric cancer, but its functions in the context of breast cancer remain unknown. Here we report that miR-301a was markedly upregulated in primary tumor samples from patients with distant metastases and pro-metastatic breast cancer cell lines. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies showed that ectopic overexpression of miR-301a promoted breast cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, Wnt/β-catenin signaling was hyperactivated in metastatic breast cancer cells that express miR-301a, and mediated miR-301a-induced invasion and metastasis. Furthermore, miR-301a directly targeted and suppressed PTEN, one negative regulator of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade. These results demonstrate that miR-301a maintains constitutively activated Wnt/β-catenin signaling by directly targeting PTEN, which promotes breast cancer invasion and metastasis. Taken together, our findings reveal a new regulatory mechanism of miR-301a and suggest that miR-301a might be a potential target in breast cancer therapy.

24316511	Title	Downregulation of histone deacetylase 1 by microRNA-520h contributes to the chemotherapeutic effect of doxorubicin.
24316511	Abstract	Doxorubicin induces DNA damage to exert its anti-cancer function. Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) can protect the genome from DNA damage. We found that doxorubicin specifically downregulates HDAC1 protein expression and identified HDAC1 as a target of miR-520h, which was upregulated by doxorubicin. Doxorubicin-induced cell death was impaired by exogenous HDAC1 or by miR-520h inhibitor. Moreover, HDAC1 reduced the level of GammaH2AX by preventing the interaction of doxorubicin with DNA. In summary, doxorubicin downregulates HDAC1 protein expression, by inducing the expression of HDAC1-targeting miR-520h, to exacerbate DNA-doxorubicin interaction. The upregulation of HDAC1 protein may contribute to drug resistance of human cancer cells and targeting HDAC1 is a promising strategy to increase the clinical efficacy of DNA damage-inducing chemotherapeutic drugs.

24316513	Title	miR-329 suppresses the growth and motility of neuroblastoma by targeting KDM1A.
24316513	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as key regulators of multiple cancers. miR-329 functions as a tumor suppressor in some malignancies. However, its role in neuroblastoma remains poorly understood. We found that miR-329 was decreased in metastatic tumor tissues compared with matched primary tumor tissues. Forced overexpression of miR-329 substantially suppressed cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion of neuroblastoma cells. Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (KDM1A) was found to be a target of miR-329. Furthermore, down-regulation of KDM1A by shRNA performed similar effects with overexpression of miR-329. Overexpression of KDM1A partially reversed the tumor suppressive effects of miR-329 in neuroblastoma cells. Collectively, miR-329 may suppress neuroblastoma cell growth and motility partially by targeting KDM1A.

24316592	Title	Up-regulation of microRNA-210 induces immune dysfunction via targeting FOXP3 in CD4(+) T cells of psoriasis vulgaris.
24316592	Abstract	Psoriasis vulgaris (PV) is a chronic inflammatory and T cell-mediated autoimmune skin disease. An immune dysfunction that is manifested by abnormally activated T cells and defective regulatory T (Treg) cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of PV. However, the precise mechanism of the immune dysfunction in PV patients still remains unclear. In this study, we found that miR-210 expression is increased significantly in CD4(+) T cells from patients with PV and confirmed that FOXP3 is a target gene of miR-210. We also found that overexpression of miR-210 inhibits FOXP3 expression and impairs the immunosuppressive functions of Treg cells in CD4(+) T cells from healthy controls. In contrast, inhibition of miR-210 increases FOXP3 expression and reverses the immune dysfunction in CD4(+) T cells from patients with PV. Our data demonstrates that increased miR-210 induces immune dysfunction via by FOXP3 in CD4(+) T cells from patients with PV.

24318902	Title	MiR-139 targets CXCR4 and inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of laryngeal squamous carcinoma cells.
24318902	Abstract	Our previous studies have showed that chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) was over-expressed in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). However, the mechanism underlying aberrant CXCR4 expression remains unclear. To investigate the roles played by miRNAs in CXCR4 over-expression in LSCC, putative miR-139 was predicted through computational algorithms, including TargetScan, PicTar and miRBase, and luciferase reporter assay was explored to confirm that whether CXCR4 was directly regulated by miR-139. Then, quantitative real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization methods were employed to detect the expression of miR-139 and CXCR4 in primary LSCC tissues, normal adjacent mucosal tissues and metastatic lesions derived from 40 LSCC patients in the Second Hospital, Xi'An JiaoTong University. Finally, gain- and loss-of-function assays were adopted to explore the effects of miR-139 and CXCR4 on proliferation, invasion and metastasis of the human LSCC cell line Hep-2 in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that miR-139 dampened CXCR4 expression, and CXCR4 was directly targeted by miR-139. Additionally, the expression of miR-139 was reduced in alignment with the progression of primary to metastatic LSCC. Moreover, an inverse correlation was observed between miR-139 and CXCR4 protein levels in LSCC specimens. Functional analyses demonstrated that ectopic expression of miR-139 inhibited cell proliferation, migration and metastasis of Hep-2 cells in vitro and in vivo. Similar to the observations seen in restoring miR-139 expression, dampening of CXCR4 expression inhibited cell growth, migration and invasion, whereas miR-139 over-expression reversed the pro-metastatic effect of CXCR4. Taken together, we conclude that miR-139 targets CXCR4 and inhibits proliferation and metastasis of LSCC.

24318997	Title	Macrophage-derived reactive oxygen species suppress miR-328 targeting CD44 in cancer cells and promote redox adaptation.
24318997	Abstract	CD44 is frequently overexpressed in a wide variety of epithelial malignancies including gastrointestinal cancer and causes resistance to currently available treatments. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that regulate molecular pathways in cancer by targeting various genes. The aim of this study was to investigate the regulation of CD44 expression by miRNAs and to develop new molecular targets in gastrointestinal cancer. We performed miRNA screening in six human gastrointestinal cancer cell lines and identified three candidate miRNAs that could regulate CD44 expression in gastrointestinal cancer. Among these, we focused on miR-328 and examined its functional relevance using growth assays and cytotoxicity assays. CD44 expression was reduced in gastrointestinal cancer cell lines forced to express miR-328, leading to inhibition of cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo, and impaired resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In contrast, induction of CD44 expression by miR-328 inhibitor led to promotion of cancer cell growth. Furthermore, we revealed that ROS produced by macrophages triggered CD44 expression through suppression of miR-328 in gastric cancer cells. Finally, tumor-infiltrating macrophages (CD68 and CD163) were closely related to both miR-328 downregulation and CD44 upregulation in 63 patients with surgically resected gastric cancer. These findings suggest that macrophages in the tumor microenvironment may cause increased CD44 expression through miR-328 suppression, resulting in tumor progression by enhancing ROS defense. miR-328-CD44 signaling mediated by macrophages may thus represent a potential target for the treatment of gastrointestinal cancer.

24335145	Title	Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta inhibits microRNA-183-96-182 cluster via the Beta-Catenin/TCF/LEF-1 pathway in gastric cancer cells.
24335145	Abstract	Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3Beta) is a critical protein kinase that phosphorylates numerous proteins in cells and thereby impacts multiple pathways including the Beta-Catenin/TCF/LEF-1 pathway. MicroRNAs (miRs) are a class of noncoding small RNAs of ∼22 nucleotides in length. Both GSK3Beta and miR play myriad roles in cell functions including stem cell development, apoptosis, embryogenesis and tumorigenesis. Here we show that GSK3Beta inhibits the expression of miR-96, miR-182 and miR-183 through the Beta-Catenin/TCF/LEF-1 pathway. Knockout of GSK3Beta in mouse embryonic fibroblast cells increases expression of miR-96, miR-182 and miR-183, coinciding with increases in the protein level and nuclear translocation of Beta-Catenin. In addition, overexpression of Beta-Catenin enhances the expression of miR-96, miR-182 and miR-183 in human gastric cancer AGS cells. GSK3Beta protein levels are decreased in human gastric cancer tissue compared with surrounding normal gastric tissue, coinciding with increases of Beta-Catenin protein, miR-96, miR-182, miR-183 and primary miR-183-96-182 cluster (pri-miR-183). Furthermore, suppression of miR-183-96-182 cluster with miRCURY LNA miR inhibitors decreases the proliferation and migration of AGS cells. Knockdown of GSK3Beta with siRNA increases the proliferation of AGS cells. Mechanistically, we show that Beta-Catenin/TCF/LEF-1 binds to the promoter of miR-183-96-182 cluster gene and thereby activates the transcription of the cluster. In summary, our findings identify a novel role for GSK3Beta in the regulation of miR-183-96-182 biogenesis through Beta-Catenin/TCF/LEF-1 pathway in gastric cancer cells.

24374340	Title	Upregulation of microRNA-107 induces proliferation in human gastric cancer cells by targeting the transcription factor FOXO1.
24374340	Abstract	MicroRNA-107 (miR-107) has been demonstrated to regulate proliferation and apoptosis in many types of cancers. Nevertheless, its biological function in gastric cancer remains largely unexplored. Here, we found that the expression level of miR-107 was increased in gastric cancer in comparison with the adjacent normal tissues. The enforced expression of miR-107 was able to promote cell proliferation in NCI-N87 and AGS cells, while miR-107 antisense oligonucleotides (antisense miR-107) blocked cell proliferation. At the molecular level, our results further revealed that expression of FOXO1 was negatively regulated by miR-107. Therefore, the data reported here demonstrate that miR-107 is an important regulator in gastric cancer, which will contribute to a better understanding of the important mis-regulated miRNAs in gastric cancer.

24375644	Title	miR-338-3p suppresses gastric cancer progression through a PTEN-AKT axis by targeting P-REX2a.
24375644	Abstract	Results from recent studies suggest that aberrant microRNA expression is common in numerous cancers. Although miR-338-3p has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma, its role in gastric cancer is unknown. To this end, we report that miR-338-3p is downregulated in both gastric cancer tissue and cell lines. Forced expression of miR-338-3p inhibited cell proliferation and clonogenicity and induced a G1-S arrest as well as apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, P-Rex2a (PREX2) was identified as a direct target of miR-338-3p, and silencing P-Rex2a resulted in the same biologic effects of miR-338-3p expression in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, both enforced expression of miR-338-3p or silencing of P-Rex2a resulted in activation of PTEN, leading to a decline in AKT phosphorylation. Also, miR-338-3p markedly inhibited the in vivo tumorigenicity in a nude mouse xenograft model system. These results demonstrate that miR-338-3p affects gastric cancer progression through PTEN-AKT signaling by targeting P-Rex2a in gastric cancer cells, which posits miR-338-3p as a novel strategy for gastric cancer treatment. miR-338-3p acts as a novel tumor suppressor that blocks the growth of gastric cancer cells through PTEN-PI3K signaling by targeting P-Rex2a.

24388988	Title	The long non-coding RNA H19-derived miR-675 modulates human gastric cancer cell proliferation by targeting tumor suppressor RUNX1.
24388988	Abstract	The lncRNA H19 has been recently shown to be upregulated and play important roles in gastric cancer tumorigenesis. However, the precise molecular mechanism of H19 and its mature product miR-675 in the carcinogenesis of gastric cancer remains unclear. In this study, we found that miR-675 was positively expressed with H19 and was a pivotal mediator in H19-induced gastric cancer cell growth promotion. Subsequently, the tumor suppressor Runt Domain Transcription Factor1 (RUNX1) was confirmed to be a direct target of miR-675 using a luciferase reporter assay and Western blotting analyses. A series of rescue assays indicated that RUNX1 mediated H19/miR-67-induced gastric cancer cell phenotypic changes. Moreover, the inverse relationship between the expression of RUNX1 and H19/miR-675 was also revealed in gastric cancer tissues and gastric cancer cell lines. Taken together, our study demonstrated that the novel pathway H19/miR-675/RUNX1 regulates gastric cancer development and may serve as a potential target for gastric cancer therapy.

24440352	Title	MicroRNA-106a targets TIMP2 to regulate invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer.
24440352	Abstract	Emerging evidence has shown that microRNA plays an important role in tumor development and progression. Here, we report that miR-106a is frequently up-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and positively correlates with metastasis. Restrained expression of miR-106a in gastric cancer cells significantly reduces their capacity of proliferation, migration and invasion. In tissue sections, the positive signal of miR-106a localized in metastasis-associated regions confirmed this result. Moreover, we show that TIMP2 is a direct downstream target for miR-106a and knockdown of TIMP2 strengthens the beneficial effects of miR-106a. Our study adds miR-106a to the complex mechanisms of tumor metastasis.

24443799	Title	MiR-133b is frequently decreased in gastric cancer and its overexpression reduces the metastatic potential of gastric cancer cells.
24443799	Abstract	Emerging evidence has shown that microRNAs are involved in gastric cancer development and progression. Here we examine the role of miR-133b in gastric cancer. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis was performed in 140 patient gastric cancer tissues and 8 gastric cancer cell lines. The effects of miR-133b in gastric cancer cells metastasis were examined by scratch assay, transwell migration and matrigel invasion. In vivo effects of miR-133b were examined in an intraperitoneal mouse tumor model. Targets of miR-133b were predicted by bioinformatics tools and validated by luciferase reporter analyses, western blot, and quantitative real-time PCR. MiR-133b was significantly downregulated in 70% (98/140) of gastric cancer patients. Expression of miR-133b was negatively correlated with lymph node metastasis of gastric cancer in patients. Similarly, the expression of miR-133b was significantly lower in seven tested gastric cancer cell lines than in the immortalized non-cancerous GES-1 gastric epithelial cells. Overexpression of miR-133b markedly inhibited metastasis of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the transcriptional factor Gli1 was identified as a direct target for miR-133b. Level of Gli1 protein but not mRNA was decreased by miR-133b. Activity of luciferase with Gli1 3'-untranslated region was markedly decreased by miR-133b in gastric cancer cells. Gli1 target genes, OPN and Zeb2, were also inhibited by miR133b. MiR-133b is frequently decreased in gastric cancer. Overexpression of miR-133b inhibits cell metastasis in vitro and in vivo partly by directly suppressing expression of Gli1 protein. These results suggested that miR-133b plays an important role in gastric cancer metastasis.

24447545	Title	RUNX3 regulates vimentin expression via miR-30a during epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gastric cancer cells.
24447545	Abstract	Runt-related transcription factor 3 (RUNX3) is a putative tumour suppressor via regulating the expression of a series of target genes. Clinical studies demonstrated that loss of RUNX3 expression is associated with gastric cancer progression and poor prognosis, but the underlying mechanism is not entirely clear. Accumulating evidence shows that the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in cancer relapse and metastasis. Therefore, we addressed whether RUNX3 has a role in the EMT in gastric cancer. Knockdown of RUNX3 promoted cell invasion and increased the protein expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin in human gastric cancer cells. Overexpression of RUNX3 suppressed cell invasion and decreased the protein expression of vimentin in the cells and inhibited gastric cancer cells colonization in nude mice. Furthermore, overexpression of RUNX3 increased the expression of microRNA-30a (miR-30a), and miR-30a directly targeted the 3' untranslated region of vimentin and decreased its protein level. miR-30a inhibitor abrogated RUNX3-mediated inhibition of cell invasion and downregulation of vimentin. Thus, RUNX3 suppressed gastric cancer cell invasion and vimentin expression by activating miR-30a. In gastric cancer patients, levels of RUNX3 were positively correlated with miR-30a and negatively associated with the levels of vimentin. Collectively, our data suggest a novel molecular mechanism for the tumour suppressor activity of RUNX3. Effective therapy targeting the RUNX3 pathway may help control gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis by inhibiting the EMT.

24481448	Title	miR-1207-5p and miR-1266 suppress gastric cancer growth and invasion by targeting telomerase reverse transcriptase.
24481448	Abstract	hTERT is the catalytic subunit of the telomerase complex. Elevated expression of hTERT is associated with the expansion and metastasis of gastric tumor. In this study, we aimed to identify novel tumor suppressor miRNAs that restrain hTERT expression. We began our screen for hTERT-targeting miRNAs with a miRNA microarray. miRNA candidates were further filtered by bioinformatic analysis, general expression pattern in different cell lines, gain-of-function effects on hTERT protein and the potential of these effects to suppress hTERT 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) luciferase activity. The clinical relevance of two miRNAs (miR-1207-5p and miR-1266) was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR. The effects of these miRNAs on cell growth, cell cycle and invasion of gastric cancer cells were measured with CCK-8, flow cytometry and transwell assays. Finally, the ability of these miRNAs to suppress the transplanted tumors was also investigated. Fourteen miRNAs were identified using a combination of bioinformatics and miRNA microarray analysis. Of these fourteen miRNAs, nine were expressed at significantly lower levels in hTERT-positive cell lines compared with hTERT-negative cell lines and five could downregulate hTERT protein expression. Only miR-1207-5p and miR-1266 interacted with the 3' UTR of hTERT and the expression levels of these two miRNAs were significantly decreased in gastric cancer tissues. These two miRNAs also inhibited gastric tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, miR-1207-5p and miR-1266 were determined to be hTERT suppressors in gastric cancer, and the delivery of these two miRNAs represents a novel therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer treatment.

24481854	Title	DNA methylation downregulated mir-10b acts as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer.
24481854	Abstract	MicroRNAs act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes. The pathological roles of miRNAs in gastric tumorigenesis are largely unknown. Although miR-10b was identified as an miRNA deregulator expressed in gastric cancer (GC), there also exists some debate on whether miR-10b is acting as tumor suppressor or oncogene in GC. Quantitative RT-PCR was employed to investigate the level of miR-10b in GC tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues (n = 100). In vitro cell proliferation, apoptosis assays, cell migration, and invasion assays were performed to elucidate the biological effects of miR-10b. Because silencing of miRNA by promoter CpG island methylation may be an important mechanism in tumorigenesis, GC cells were treated with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and trichostatin A, and expression changes of miR-10b were subsequently examined by quantitative RT-PCR. Furthermore, the methylation status of the CpG island upstream of miR-10b was analyzed by methylation-specific PCR in GC tissues (n = 29). We showed here that miR-10b was significantly downregulated in GC cell lines and tissues as demonstrated by quantitative real-time PCR. Overexpression of miR-10b in MGC-803 and HGC-27 dramatically suppressed cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and induced apoptosis. Moreover, we demonstrated that T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis (Tiam1) was a target of miR-10b. Furthermore, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and trichostain A increased miR-10b expression, and the methylation level was high in the CpG islands upstream of miR-10b gene. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-10b may function as a novel tumor suppressor and is partially silenced by DNA hypermethylation in GC.

In this study, we identified TFF1 as a novel target gene of miRNA-423-5p. miRNA-423-5p negatively regulated the expression of TFF1 by binding to its 3'UTR and participated in proliferation/invasion-related processes via a TFF1-dependent manner in gastric cancer cells. Our findings suggested that miR-423-5p may be a novel target for the future development of specific therapeutic interventions for gastric cancer.

24495516	Title	MicroRNA-362 induces cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance in gastric cancer by activation of NF-KappaB signaling.
24495516	Abstract	According to cancer-related microRNA (miRNA) expression microarray research available in public databases, miR-362 expression is elevated in gastric cancer. However, the expression and biological role of miR-362 in gastric progression remain unclear. miR-362 expression levels in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines were determined using real-time PCR. The roles of miR-362, in promoting gastric cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance, were assessed by different biological assays, such as colony assay, flow cytometry and TUNEL assay. The effect of miR-362 on NF-KappaB activation was investigated using the luciferase reporter assay, fluorescent immunostaining. MiR-362 overexpression induced cell proliferation, colony formation, and resistance to cisplatin-induced apoptosis in BGC-823 and SGC-7901 gastric cancer cells. MiR-362 increased NF-KappaB activity and relative mRNA expression of NF-KappaB-regulated genes, and induced nuclear translocation of p65. Expression of the tumor suppressor CYLD was inhibited by miR-362 in gastric cancer cells; miR-362 levels were inversely correlated with CYLD expression in gastric cancer tissue. MiR-362 downregulated CYLD expression by binding its 3' untranslated region. NF-KappaB activation was mechanistically associated with siRNA-mediated downregulation of CYLD. MiR-362 inhibitor reversed all the effects of miR-362. The results suggest that miR-362 plays an important role in repressing the tumor suppressor CYLD and present a novel mechanism of miRNA-mediated NF-KappaB activation in gastric cancer.

24495805	Abstract	Gastric cancer (GC) is the second common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the carcinogenesis of GC. Here, we found that miR-22 was significantly decreased in GC tissue samples and cell lines. Ectopic overexpression of miR-22 remarkably suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation of GC cells. Moreover, overexpression of miR-22 significantly suppressed migration and invasion of GC cells. CD151 was found to be a target of miR-22. Furthermore, overexpression of CD151 significantly attenuated the tumor suppressive effect of miR-22. Taken together, miR-22 might suppress GC cells growth and motility partially by inhibiting CD151.

24498243	Title	MicroRNA-10a is down-regulated by DNA methylation and functions as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer cells.
24498243	Abstract	MicroRNAs act as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression in many biological processes. Their deregulations occur commonly in gastric cancer (GC). Although DNA methylation constitutes an important mechanism for microRNA deregulation in cancer, this field largely remains unexplored. Total RNA was extracted from the tissues of 100 patients with GC and four gastric cancer cell lines. The expression levels of miR-10a were determined by real-time PCR with specific TaqMan probes. Moreover, a functional analysis of miR-10a in regulating cell proliferation, migration and invasion was performed. Subsequently, quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) was used to detect the DNA methylation status in the CpG islands upstream of miR-10a. In this study, we found that the expression of miR-10a in GC cells was lower than that in normal cells, which was due to the hypermethylation of the CpG islands upstream of miR-10a. We also validated the slightly lower expression of miR-10a in GC tissues than their adjacent non-neoplastic tissues in 100 GC patients and confirmed the hypermethylation of CpG islands upstream of miR-10a in some patients. Furthermore, re-introduction of miR-10a into GC cells was able to inhibit cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Bioinformatic and immunoblot analysis indicated that the tumor suppressor roles of miR-10a in GC cells were possibly through targeting HOXA1. Our data indicate that miR-10a acts as a tumor suppressor in GC cells and is partially silenced by DNA hypermethylation in GC, suggesting that miR-10a may serve as a potential diagnostic or therapeutic target of GC.

24515776	Title	MiR-148a regulates MEG3 in gastric cancer by targeting DNA methyltransferase 1.
24515776	Abstract	The long non-coding RNA MEG3 has been reported to be a tumor suppressor in a number of malignant tumors including gastric cancer. Several studies have shown that the regulation of MEG3 may attribute to the promoter hypermethylation. However, the mechanism of MEG3 regulation in gastric cancer is still not well understood. MiR-148a can suppress gastric tumorigenesis through regulating the expression of target genes such as DNA methyltransferase 1(DNMT-1). We examined the expression of MEG3 in 52 gastric cancer samples using quantitative real-time PCR and found the down-regulation of MEG3 in both gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. The positive correlation of MEG3 and miR-148a was further confirmed in SGC-7901 and BGC-823 gastric cancer cell lines. Hypermethylation of MEG3 differentially methylated regions was identified by methylation-specific PCR, and MEG3 expression was increased with the inhibition of methylation with siRNA to DNMT-1 in gastric cancer cells. In addition, transfection of MEG3 siRNA into gastric cancer cells diminished the suppression of proliferation induced by overexpression of miR-148a. Our results suggest that the suppression of miR-148a may contribute to the down-regulation of MEG3 in gastric cancer by modulation of DNMT-1.

24516043	Title	Reduced expression of miRNA-27a modulates cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer by targeting the cystine/glutamate exchanger SLC7A11.
24516043	Abstract	Resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy is a major obstacle to bladder cancer treatment. We aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNA) that are dysregulated in cisplatin-resistant disease, ascertain how these contribute to a drug-resistant phenotype, and how this resistance might be overcome. miRNA expression in paired cisplatin-resistant and -sensitive cell lines was measured. Dysregulated miRNAs were further studied for their ability to mediate resistance. The nature of the cisplatin-resistant phenotype was established by measurement of cisplatin/DNA adducts and intracellular glutathione (GSH). Candidate miRNAs were examined for their ability to (i) mediate resistance and (ii) alter the expression of a candidate target protein (SLC7A11); direct regulation of SLC7A11 was confirmed using a luciferase assay. SLC7A11 protein and mRNA, and miRNA-27a were quantified in patient tumor material. A panel of miRNAs were found to be dysregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells. miRNA-27a was found to target the cystine/glutamate exchanger SLC7A11 and to contribute to cisplatin resistance through modulation of GSH biosynthesis. In patients, SLC7A11 expression was inversely related to miRNA-27a expression, and those tumors with high mRNA expression or high membrane staining for SLC7A11 experienced poorer clinical outcomes. Resistant cell lines were resensitized by restoring miRNA-27a expression or reducing SLC7A11 activity with siRNA or with sulfasalazine. Our findings indicate that miRNA-27a negatively regulates SLC7A11 in cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer, and shows promise as a marker for patients likely to benefit from cisplatin-based chemotherapy. SLC7A11 inhibition with sulfasalazine may be a promising therapeutic approach to the treatment of cisplatin-resistant disease.

24517338	Abstract	Recent evidence suggests that the prostate cancer (PCa)-specific up-regulation of certain genes such as AMACR, EZH2, PSGR, PSMA and TRPM8 could be associated with an aberrant expression of non-coding microRNAs (miRNA). In silico analyses were used to search for miRNAs being putative regulators of PCa-associated genes. The expression of nine selected miRNAs (hsa-miR-101, -138, -186, -224, -26a, -26b, -374a, -410, -660) as well as of the aforementioned PCa-associated genes was analyzed by quantitative PCR using 50 malignant (Tu) and matched non-malignant (Tf) tissue samples from prostatectomy specimens as well as 30 samples from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Then, correlations between paired miRNA and target gene expression levels were analyzed. Furthermore, the effect of exogenously administered miR-26a on selected target genes was determined by quantitative PCR and Western Blot in various PCa cell lines. A luciferase reporter assay was used for target validation. The expression of all selected miRNAs was decreased in PCa tissue samples compared to either control group (Tu vs Tf: -1.35 to -5.61-fold; Tu vs BPH: -1.17 to -5.49-fold). The down-regulation of most miRNAs inversely correlated with an up-regulation of their putative target genes with Spearman correlation coefficients ranging from -0.107 to -0.551. MiR-186 showed a significantly diminished expression in patients with non-organ confined PCa and initial metastases. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-26a reduced the mRNA and protein expression of its potential target gene AMACR in vitro. Using the luciferase reporter assay AMACR was validated as new target for miR-26a. The findings of this study indicate that the expression of specific miRNAs is decreased in PCa and inversely correlates with the up-regulation of their putative target genes. Consequently, miRNAs could contribute to oncogenesis and progression of PCa via an altered miRNA-target gene-interaction.

24518294	Title	β1 integrin inhibition elicits a prometastatic switch through the TGFβ-miR-200-ZEB network in E-cadherin-positive triple-negative breast cancer.
24518294	Abstract	Interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) through integrin adhesion receptors provide cancer cells with physical and chemical cues that act together with growth factors to support survival and proliferation. Antagonists that target integrins containing the β1 subunit inhibit tumor growth and sensitize cells to irradiation or cytotoxic chemotherapy in preclinical breast cancer models and are under clinical investigation. We found that the loss of β1 integrins attenuated breast tumor growth but markedly enhanced tumor cell dissemination to the lungs. When cultured in three-dimensional ECM scaffolds, antibodies that blocked β1 integrin function or knockdown of β1 switched the migratory behavior of human and mouse E-cadherin-positive triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells from collective to single cell movement. This switch involved activation of the transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) signaling network that led to a shift in the balance between miR-200 microRNAs and the transcription factor zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2), resulting in suppressed transcription of the gene encoding E-cadherin. Reducing the abundance of a TGFβ receptor, restoring the ZEB/miR-200 balance, or increasing the abundance of E-cadherin reestablished cohesion in β1 integrin-deficient cells and reduced dissemination to the lungs without affecting growth of the primary tumor. These findings reveal that β1 integrins control a signaling network that promotes an epithelial phenotype and suppresses dissemination and indicate that targeting β1 integrins may have undesirable effects in TNBC.

24519663	Title	Regulatory roles of miRNA in the human neural stem cell transformation to glioma stem cells.
24519663	Abstract	To investigate the expressional alternation of microRNAs (miRNA) during the malignant transformation and development of human glioma, we measured miRNA expression profile as well as mRNA expression profile in normal human neural stem cells (hNSCs) and human glioma stem cells (hGSCs). We found 116 miRNA up-regulated and 62 miRNA down-regulated in GSCs. On the other hand, we identified 1,372 mRNA down-regulated, and 1,501 mRNA up-regulated in GSCs compared to those in NSCs. We then analyzed the pathways and the predicted target genes of the miRNAs which differ significantly in expression between GSCs and NSCs using the statistical enrichment methods. These target mRNAs are involved in many cancer-related signaling pathways, such as cell cycle, axon guidance, glioma development, adhesion junction, MAPK and Wnt signaling. Furthermore, we obtained the differently expressed miRNA-target relationships according to the θ value which is used to calculate the regulation extent of miRNA-target and using the databases of miRanda, Targetscans and Pictar. Among the top 10 miRNA-target relationships, hsa-miR-198 and its potential targeted gene DCX and NNAT were selected for validation, and NNAT was found to be the direct target of miR-198. Finally, the functional roles of miR-155-5p and miR-124-3p whose expressions altered significantly between GSCs and NSCs were addressed. Our results provide new clues for the potential mechanisms involved in the origin and development of glioma. Clinically, the altered miRNAs may serve as potential targets and diagnostic tools for novel therapeutic strategies of glioblastoma.

24520312	Title	The microRNA expression signature of bladder cancer by deep sequencing: the functional significance of the miR-195/497 cluster.
24520312	Abstract	Current genome-wide microRNA (miRNA) expression signature analysis using deep sequencing technologies can drive the discovery of novel cancer pathways regulated by oncogenic and/or tumor suppressive miRNAs. We determined the genome-wide miRNA expression signature in bladder cancer (BC) by deep sequencing technology. A total of ten small RNA libraries were sequenced (five BCs and five samples of histologically normal bladder epithelia (NBE)), and 13,190,619 to 18,559,060 clean small RNA reads were obtained. A total of 933 known miRNAs and 17 new miRNA candidates were detected in this analysis. Among the known miRNAs, a total of 60 miRNAs were significantly downregulated in BC compared with NBE. We also found that several miRNAs, such as miR-1/133a, miR-206/133b, let-7c/miR-99a, miR-143/145 and miR-195/497, were located close together at five distinct loci and constituted clustered miRNAs. Among these clustered miRNAs, we focused on the miR-195/497 cluster because this clustered miRNA had not been analyzed in BC. Transfection of mature miR-195 or miR-497 in two BC cell lines (BOY and T24) significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, suggesting that the miR-195/497 cluster functioned as tumor suppressors in BC. Regarding the genes targeted by the miR-195/497 cluster, the TargetScan algorithm showed that 6,730 genes were putative miR-195/497 targets, and 113 significantly enriched signaling pathways were identified in this analysis. The "Pathways in cancer" category was the most enriched, involving 104 candidate target genes. Gene expression data revealed that 27 of 104 candidate target genes were actually upregulated in BC clinical specimens. Luciferase reporter assays and Western blotting demonstrated that BIRC5 and WNT7A were directly targeted by miR-195/497. In conclusion, aberrant expression of clustered miRNAs was identified by deep sequencing, and downregulation of miR-195/497 contributed to BC progression and metastasis. Tumor suppressive miRNA-mediated cancer pathways provide new insights into the potential mechanisms of BC oncogenesis.

24522920	Title	MicroRNA 155 regulates Japanese encephalitis virus-induced inflammatory response by targeting Src homology 2-containing inositol phosphatase 1.
24522920	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are single-stranded small RNA molecules that regulate various cellular processes. miRNA 155 (miR-155) regulates various aspects of innate and adaptive immune responses and plays a key role in various viral infections and the resulting neuroinflammation. The present study evaluated the involvement of miR-155 in modulating Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)-induced neuroinflammation. We observed that miR-155 expression was upregulated during JEV infection of mouse primary microglia, the BV-2 microglia cell line, and in both mouse and human brains. In vitro and in vivo knockdown of miR-155 minimized JEV-induced inflammatory responses. In the present study, we confirmed targeting of the Src homology 2-containing inositol phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) 3' untranslated region (UTR) by miR-155 in the context of JEV infection. Inhibition of SHIP1 by miR-155 resulted in higher beta interferon (IFN-β) and proinflammatory cytokine production through activation of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1). Based on these observations, we conclude that miR-155 modulates the neuroinflammatory response during JEV infection via negative regulation of SHIP1 expression. Thus, modulation of miR-155 could be a novel strategy to regulate JEV-induced neuroinflammation. Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), a member of the family Flaviviridae that causes Japanese encephalitis (JE), is the most common mosquito-borne encephalitis virus in the Asia-Pacific region. The disease is feared, as currently there are no specific antiviral drugs available. JEV targets the central nervous system, leading to high mortality and neurological and psychiatric sequelae in some of those who survive. The level of inflammation correlates well with the clinical outcome in patients. Recently, microRNA (miRNA), a single-stranded noncoding RNA, has been implicated in various brain disorders. The present study investigates the role of miRNA in JEV-induced neuroinflammation. Our results show that miRNA 155 (miR-155) targets the Src homology 2-containing inositol phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) protein and promotes inflammation by regulating the NF-κB pathway, increasing the expression of various proinflammatory cytokines and the antiviral response. Thus, miR-155 is a potential therapeutic target to develop antivirals in JE and other brain disorders where inflammation plays a significant role in disease progression.

24523440	Title	Primate-specific miR-663 functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting PIK3CD and predicts the prognosis of human glioblastoma.
24523440	Abstract	To determine the prognostic significance of miR-663 in glioblastoma, its effect in tumor progression, and the underlying mechanism. Specimens from 256 cases of patients with glioma, including 239 patients with follow-up information, were used to analyze the association between miR-663 and patients' prognosis by Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The effects of miR-663 on glioblastoma cell proliferation and invasion were examined both in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatics prediction and signal network analysis were applied to identify the putative targets of miR-663, which were further verified by luciferase reporter assay, rescue experiments as well as the immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting examination of downstream effectors. Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) and IHC were applied to investigate the clinical association between miR-663 and its target in human glioblastoma specimens. miR-663 was inversely correlated with glioma grades but positively correlated with patients' survival. Furthermore, two distinct subgroups of patients with glioblastoma with different prognoses were identified on the basis of miR-663 expression in our specimens and that from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Overexpression of miR-663 significantly suppressed the proliferation and invasion of glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we discovered PIK3CD as a direct target of miR-663 and found that phosphorylated AKT and three key downstream effectors of PIK3CD, i.e., CCND1, MMP2, and MMP7, were downregulated by miR-663 overexpression. Moreover, PIK3CD was inversely correlated with miR-663 in glioblastoma specimens and predicted poor prognosis of patients with glioblastoma. miR-663 is a novel prognostic biomarker and a potential therapeutic candidate for glioblastoma.

24525189	Title	Drosophila miR-9a targets the ECM receptor Dystroglycan to canalize myotendinous junction formation.
24525189	Abstract	Establishment of intercellular interactions between various cell types of different origin is vital for organism development and tissue maintenance. Therefore, precise timing, expression pattern, and amounts of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins must be tightly regulated. Particularly, the ECM is important for the development and function of myotendinous junctions (MTJs). We find that precise levels of the ECM receptor Dystroglycan (Dg) are required for MTJ formation in Drosophila and that Dg levels in this process are controlled by miR-9a. In the embryo, Dg is enriched at the termini of the growing muscles facing the tendon matrix and absent from miR-9a-expressing tendons. This gradient of Dg expression is crucial for proper muscle-tendon attachments and is adjusted by miR-9a. In addition to Dg, miR-9a regulates the expression of several other critical muscle genes, and we therefore propose that during embryogenesis, miR-9a specifically controls the expression of mesodermal genes to canalize MTJ morphogenesis.

24525454	Title	Post-transcriptional regulation of human breast cancer cell proteome by unliganded estrogen receptor β via microRNAs.
24525454	Abstract	Estrogen receptor β (ERβ) is a member of the nuclear receptor family of homeostatic regulators that is frequently lost in breast cancer (BC), where its presence correlates with a better prognosis and a less aggressive clinical outcome of the disease. In contrast to ERα, its closest homolog, ERβ shows significant estrogen-independent activities, including the ability to inhibit cell cycle progression and regulate gene transcription in the absence of the ligand. Investigating the nature and extent of this constitutive activity of ERβ in BC MCF-7 and ZR-75.1 cells by means of microRNA (miRNA) sequencing, we identified 30 miRNAs differentially expressed in ERβ+ versus ERβ- cells in the absence of ligand, including up-regulated oncosuppressor miRs such miR-30a. In addition, a significant fraction of >1,600 unique proteins identified in MCF-7 cells by iTRAQ quantitative proteomics were either increased or decreased by ERβ, revealing regulation of multiple cell pathways by ligand-free receptors. Transcriptome analysis showed that for a large number of proteins regulated by ERβ, the corresponding mRNAs are unaffected, including a large number of putative targets of ERβ-regulated miRNAs, indicating a central role of miRNAs in mediating BC cell proteome regulation by ERβ. Expression of a mimic of miR-30a-5p, a direct target and downstream effector of ERβ in BC, led to the identification of several target transcripts of this miRNA, including 11 encoding proteins whose intracellular concentration was significantly affected by unliganded receptor. These results demonstrate a significant effect of ligand-free ERβ on BC cell functions via modulation of the cell proteome and suggest that miRNA regulation might represent a key event in the control of the biological and clinical phenotype of hormone-responsive BC by this nuclear receptor.

24528955	Title	MicroRNA expression and regulation in the uterus during embryo implantation in rat.
24528955	Abstract	Embryo implantation is a complex initial step in establishment of a successful pregnancy. Many mRNAs have been shown to be differentially expressed in the rat uterus during embryo implantation. However, the expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs), a key post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression, in the rat uterus between the pre-receptive and receptive phases are still unknown. Here, an miRNA microarray was used to examine differential expression of miRNAs in the rat uterus between the pre-receptive and receptive phases. Twenty-eight miRNAs were up-regulated and 29 miRNAs were down-regulated at least twofold during the receptive phase in rat uterus; these results were confirmed by Northern blotting. miR-29a was only highly expressed in rat uterus during the implantation period, and activation of delayed implantation and artificial decidualization enhanced the miR-29a level. Further investigation revealed that both the pro-apoptotic factor genes Bak1 and Bmf and the anti-apoptotic factor gene Bcl-w are targets of miR-29a. There was weak binding between miR-29a and the 3' UTR of the anti-apoptotic factor gene Mcl1. Over-expression of miR-29a inhibited the late apoptosis of endometrial stromal cells, which may be due to the stronger binding capacity between miR-29a and the 3' UTR of pro-apoptotic factors than that between miR-29a and the 3' UTR of anti-apoptotic factors. Collectively, miR-29a plays an important role during embryo implantation by regulating both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic factors. miR-29a may predominantly bind pro-apoptotic factors, leading to inhibition of cell apoptosis.

24529171	Title	Up-regulated MicroRNA-181a induces carcinogenesis in hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting E2F5.
24529171	Abstract	Accumulating evidence showed that microRNAs are involved in development and progression of multiple tumors. Recent studies have found that miR-181a were dysregulated in several types of cancers, however, the function of miR-181a in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. In this study we assessed the potential association between miR-181a, HBV and HCC. The expression of miR-181a in HBV-expressing cells was determined by using qRT-PCR. Dual-Luciferase reporter Assay, qRT-PCR and western blot were performed to investigate the target genes of miR-181a. The effects of miR-181a on HCC proliferation were analyzed by MTS and colony formation assay. Tumor growth assay was used to analyze the effect of miR-181a on tumor formation. HBV up-regulated miR-181a expression by enhancing its promoter activity. Overexpression of miR-181a in hepatoma cells promoted cell growth in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Conversely, inhibition of miR-181a suppressed the proliferation of HBV-expressing cells. Mechanism investigation revealed that miR-181a inhibited the expression of transcription factor E2F5 by specifically targeting its mRNA 3'UTR. Moreover, E2F5 inhibition induced cell growth and rescued the suppressive effect of miR-181a inhibitor on the proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells. Interestingly, we also discovered that HBV could down-regulate E2F5 expression. Those results strongly suggested that HBV down-regulated E2F5 expression, in part, by up-regulating the expression of miR-181a. Up-regulation of miR-181a by HBV in hepatoma cells may contribute to the progression of HCC possibly by targeting E2F5, suggesting miR-181a plays important role in HCC development.

24530415	Title	Role of microRNA-95 in the anticancer activity of Brucein D in hepatocellular carcinoma.
24530415	Abstract	Brucea javanica fruit has been used to treat amebic dysentery, malaria and various parasites and it has been applied as an anti-cancer agent in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Brucein D (BD) is a naturally occurring compound extracted from Brucea javanica fruit which shows anti-cancer activity against pancreatic cancer. Here, we further demonstrated that BD inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell growth in vitro and tumor growth in vivo that were attributed to the induction of cell apoptosis. BD did not exert growth inhibition on non-tumorigenic human hepatocytes. MTT assay was used to measure cell viability. Annexin V and TUNEL assay were applied to identify apoptotic cells in cell suspension and in tissue section respectively. Downstream micro-RNA (miRNA) targets of BD were screened out by miRNA array. miRNAs and their target proteins were identified by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. 39 miRNAs regulated by BD in HCC were identified. miR-95 was found to be a potential drug target of BD. We further identified CUG triplet repeat RNA-binding protein 2 (CUGBP2) as the downstream target of miR-95. Our data suggested that BD exerted its anti-cancer activity against HCC through modulation of miR-95 expression.

24530761	Title	Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 targeted by miR-15a regulates inflammation in acute coronary syndrome.
24530761	Abstract	Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) is essential for the activation of a subset of NF-кB-dependent genes, which code the chemokines triggering plaque vulnerability. Unstable atherosclerotic plaques lead to the onset of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether CARM1 is involved in the pathogenesis of ACS and ascertain the regulatory mechanism of CARM1 expression at posttranscriptional level. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from peripheral blood of 19 patients with ACS and 22 subjects with risk factors for coronary heart disease. Gene expression was determined by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. The effects of CARM1 and miR-15a on their target genes expression were assessed by gain-of-function and loss-of-function approaches. PBMCs from patients with ACS showed higher levels of CARM1 mRNA and protein expression. The levels of CARM1 mRNA were positively correlated with three chemokines including interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in PBMCs (CARM1 and IP-10: r=0.55, P=0.008; CARM1 and MCP-1: r=0.64, P=0.002; CARM1 and IL-8: r=0.55, P=0.008). Moreover, CARM1 regulated the transcription of these chemokines in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells. We also found that the levels of miR-15a were decreased by 37% in patients with ACS and miR-15a modulated CARM1 expression through targeted binding to CARM1 3'-UTR. The present study demonstrated that CARM1 targeted by miR-15a played an important role in chemokine activation in the pathogenesis of ACS.

24530979	Title	MiR-495 suppresses mesendoderm differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells via the direct targeting of Dnmt3a.
24530979	Abstract	Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are promising resources for clinical therapies due to their potential to generate multiple cell types. The dynamic expression of de novo methyltransferases (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) is essential to ESCs; however, the regulatory mechanism of Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b expression in ESCs is still poorly understood. Here, we reported that decreased expression of microRNA-495 (miR-495) in the first 2days of embryoid body (EB) formation was required for mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation because repressed mesoderm and endoderm lineages were detected in ectopic miR-495 expression mESCs. This effect was reversed by the function blockade of miR-495. We identified Dnmt3a as a functional target of miR-495 and showed that endogenous miR-495 repressed the expression of Dnmt3a in mESCs. Furthermore, the effect of miR-495 on mESCs could be eliminated by Dnmt3a overexpression. Moreover, miR-495 had no effect on the expression of Dnmt3b despite the findings obtained from previous studies that mainly focused on the common characteristics of the regulatory mechanisms of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b expression. Thus, our studies not only uncovered a previously uncharacterized function of miR-495 in mESC differentiation but also generated a new idea to explore the mechanisms governing the functional difference between Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b.

24531537	Title	Autophagic program is regulated by miR-325.
24531537	Abstract	Autophagy is required for the maintenance of cardiomyocytes homeostasis. However, the abnormal autophagy could lead to the development of heart failure. Autophagy is enhanced during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion; it remains to elucidate the molecular regulation of autophagy. We report here that miR-325, ARC and E2F1 constitute an axis that regulates autophagy. Our results showed that miR-325 expression is upregulated upon anoxia/reoxygenation and ischemia/reperfusion. Cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of the miR-325 potentiates autophagic responses and myocardial infarct sizes, whereas knockdown of miR-325 inhibited autophagy and cell death. We searched for the downstream mediator of miR-325 and identified that ARC is a target of miR-325. ARC transgenic mice could attenuate autophagy and myocardial infarction sizes upon pressure-overload-induced heart failure, whereas ARC null mice exhibited an increased autophagic accumulation in the heart. The suppression of ARC by miR-325 led to its inability to repress autophagic program. In exploring the molecular mechanism by which miR-325 expression is regulated, our results revealed that the transcription factor E2F1 contributed to promote miR-325 expression. E2F1 null mice demonstrated reduced autophagy and myocardial infarction sizes upon ischemia/reperfusion. Our present study reveals a novel autophagic regulating model that is composed of E2F1, miR-325 and ARC. Modulation of their levels may provide a new approach for tackling cardiac failure.

24531888	Title	MicroRNA-181a Functions as an Oncomir in Gastric Cancer by Targeting the Tumour Suppressor Gene ATM.
24531888	Abstract	Based on our previous experiments, this study is to further investigate the functional significance of miR-181a and its target gene in gastric cancer. Expression of miR-181a was detected by qRT-PCR in three normal gastric tissues and three human gastric cancer cell lines (SGC-7901, MGC-803, and BGC-823 cells). After transfection with miR-181a inhibitor, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of the SGC-7901 cells were evaluated. Ataxia-telangiectasia mutation (ATM) was predicted as a target gene of miR-181a with bioinformatics analysis, and was verified by lucifersae reporter assay. Expression of ATM protein in HEK293T cells and tissues was measured by Western Blot. Expression of ATM mRNA in HEK293T cells was measured by RT-PCR. Compared with three non-tumour tissues, the expression of miR-181a in three gastric cancer cells was significantly increased by 26.68, 14.83 and 14.96 folds; Compared with Negative Control(NC) and blank groups, transfection of miR-181a inhibitor led to inhibition of SGC7901 cell proliferation, invasion, and migration as well as promotion of apoptosis. A luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that ATM was a direct target of miR-181a, miR-181a mimics transfection down regulated ATM mRNA and protein expression. There was inverse correlation between miR-181a and ATM protein expression in gastric cancer and normal gastric tissues. Our study demonstrates that over-expression of miR-181a might be involved in development of gastric cancer by promoting proliferation and inhibiting apoptosis probably through directly targeting ATM. miR-181a modulation may be a potential strategy for the development of miRNA-based therapy of gastric cancer.

24532280	Title	Low expression of microRNA-126 is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer.
24532280	Abstract	MicroRNA-126 (miR-126) has been reported to be a tumor suppressor that targets CXCR4 in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. This study investigated whether miR-126 has any prognostic impact in patients with CRC. MiR-126 and CXCR4 mRNA expression in 92 pairs of CRC and adjacent nontumorous tissues was examined using quantitative real-time PCR, and CXCR4 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Western blotting. The correlation between miR-126 and CXCR4 protein expression and clinicopathological features and overall survival rate was determined. MiR-126 was downregulated in CRC tissues that expressed high levels of CXCR4 mRNA. IHC and Western blotting detected high expression of CXCR4 protein in CRC tissues. An inverse correlation was observed between miR-126 and CXCR4 protein expression in CRC tissues. Moreover, low miR-126 and high CXCR4 protein expression was associated with distant metastasis, clinical TNM stage, and poor survival. Multivariate analysis indicated that miR-126 was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival, suggesting its clinical significance as a prognostic predictor in CRC patients.

24532687	Title	A positive feedback between p53 and miR-34 miRNAs mediates tumor suppression.
24532687	Abstract	As bona fide p53 transcriptional targets, miR-34 microRNAs (miRNAs) exhibit frequent alterations in many human tumor types and elicit multiple p53 downstream effects upon overexpression. Unexpectedly, miR-34 deletion alone fails to impair multiple p53-mediated tumor suppressor effects in mice, possibly due to the considerable redundancy in the p53 pathway. Here, we demonstrate that miR-34a represses HDM4, a potent negative regulator of p53, creating a positive feedback loop acting on p53. In a Kras-induced mouse lung cancer model, miR-34a deficiency alone does not exhibit a strong oncogenic effect. However, miR-34a deficiency strongly promotes tumorigenesis when p53 is haploinsufficient, suggesting that the defective p53-miR-34 feedback loop can enhance oncogenesis in a specific context. The importance of the p53/miR-34/HDM4 feedback loop is further confirmed by an inverse correlation between miR-34 and full-length HDM4 in human lung adenocarcinomas. In addition, human lung adenocarcinomas generate an elevated level of a short HDM4 isoform through alternative polyadenylation. This short HDM4 isoform lacks miR-34-binding sites in the 3' untranslated region (UTR), thereby evading miR-34 regulation to disable the p53-miR-34 positive feedback. Taken together, our results elucidated the intricate cross-talk between p53 and miR-34 miRNAs and revealed an important tumor suppressor effect generated by this positive feedback loop.

24533100	Title	Comprehensive analysis of human cytomegalovirus microRNA expression during lytic and quiescent infection.
24533100	Abstract	Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encodes microRNAs (miRNAs) that function as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression during lytic infection in permissive cells. Some miRNAs have been shown to suppress virus replication, which could help HCMV to establish or maintain latent infection. However, HCMV miRNA expression has not been comprehensively examined and compared using cell culture systems representing permissive (lytic) and semi-permissive vs. non-permissive (latent-like) infection. Viral miRNAs levels and expression kinetics during HCMV infection were determined by miRNA-specific stem-loop RT-PCR. HCMV infected THP-1 (non-permissive), differentiated THP-1 (d-THP-1, semi-permissive) and human embryo lung fibroblasts (HELs, fully-permissive) were examined. The impact of selected miRNAs on HCMV infection (gene expression, genome replication and virus release) was determined by Western blotting, RT-PCR, qPCR, and plaque assay. Abundant expression of 15 HCMV miRNAs was observed during lytic infection in HELs; highest peak inductions (11- to 1502-fold) occurred at 48 hpi. In d-THP-1s, fourteen mRNAs were detected with moderate induction (3- to 288-fold), but kinetics of expression was generally delayed for 24 h relative to HELs. In contrast, only three miRNAs were induced to low levels (3- to 4-fold) during quiescent infection in THP-1s. Interestingly, miR-UL70-3p was poorly induced in HEL (1.5-fold), moderately in THP-1s (4-fold), and strongly (58-fold) in d-THP-1s, suggesting a potentially specific role for miR-UL70-3p in THP-1s and d-THP-1s. MiR-US33, -UL22A and -UL70 were further evaluated for their impact on HCMV replication in HELs. Ectopic expression of miR-UL22A and miR-UL70 did not affect HCMV replication in HELs, whereas miR-US33 inhibited HCMV replication and reduced levels of HCMV US29 mRNA, confirming that US29 is a target of miR-US33. Viral miRNA expression kinetics differs between permissive, semi-permissive and quiescent infections, and miR-US33 down-regulates HCMV replication. These results suggest that miR-US33 may function to impair entry into lytic replication and hence promote establishment of latency.

24533778	Title	MKK7 mediates miR-493-dependent suppression of liver metastasis of colon cancer cells.
24533778	Abstract	The prognosis of advanced colon cancer patients is profoundly affected by the presence or absence of liver metastasis. miR-493 functions as a potent suppressor of liver metastasis, and low-level miR-493 expression in human primary colon cancer is associated with an elevated incidence of liver metastasis. We previously showed that IGF1R is a target gene of miR-493, and that the inhibition of IGF1R partly explains how miR-493 suppresses liver metastasis. However, major functional targets that mediate the antimetastatic activity of miR-493 remain elusive. Here, we extended our search for target genes and identified MKK7, a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, as a novel target of miR-493. miR-493 inhibits MKK7 expression by targeting the binding site at the 3'-UTR of the mkk7 gene. MKK7 was expressed in six out of seven colon cancer cell lines examined but not in non-transformed colon epithelial cells, and its expression was required for the activating phosphorylation of JNK. RNA interference-mediated inhibition of MKK7 resulted in marked suppression of liver metastasis of colon cancer cells. A significant decrease of metastasized cells by the MKK7 knockdown was observed, even at early stages of the metastatic settlement, in accordance with a time course of the miR-493-mediated inhibition of the metastasis. Immunohistochemical examination in human primary colon tumors revealed that the occurrence of liver metastasis is associated with elevated levels of MKK7. Thus, MKK7 is a major functional target of miR-493, and its suppression thwarts liver metastasis of colon cancer cells.

24535747	Title	MicroRNA-29a modulates axon branching by targeting doublecortin in primary neurons.
24535747	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously expressed small, non-coding transcripts that regulate protein expression. Substantial evidences suggest that miRNAs are enriched in central nervous system, where they are hypothesized to play pivotal roles during neural development. In the present study, we analyzed miRNAs expression in mice cerebral cortex and hippocampus at different developmental stages and found miR-29a increased dramatically at postnatal stages. In addition, we provided strong evidences that miR-29a is enriched in mature neurons both in vitro and in vivo. Further investigation demonstrated that the activation of glutamate receptors induced endogenous miR-29a level in primary neurons. Moreover, we showed that miR-29a directly regulated its target protein Doublecortin (DCX) expression, which further modulated axon branching in primary culture. Together, our results suggested that miR-29a play an important role in neuronal development of mice cerebrum.

24548484	Title	Downregulated RASD1 and upregulated miR-375 are involved in protective effects of calycosin on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats.
24548484	Abstract	Isoflavone calycosin is a typical phytoestrogen extracted from Chinese medical herb Radix Astragali. It has been reported that estrogens could provide neuroprotective effects, and dietary intake of phytoestrogens could reduce stroke injury in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) animal models. In the present study, we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of calycosin on middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. Focal cerebral ischemia was induced in male rats by MCAO, neurological deficits and brain edema was evaluated after 24h of reperfusion. The results shown calycosin significantly reduced the infarcted volume and the brain water content, and improved the neurological deficit. To provide insight into the functions of estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated signaling pathway in neuroprotection by calycosin, the expression of miR-375, ER-α, RASD1 (Dexamethasone-induced Ras-related protein 1) and Bcl-2 was determined by RT-PCR or western blot assay. Calycosin exhibited a downregulation of RASD1, and an upregulation of ER-α, miR-375 and Bcl-2. Our finding illustrated that calycosin had been shown neuroprotective effects in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion rats, and the molecular mechanisms may correlate with the positive feedback between ER-α and miR-375, along with the regulation of downstream targets.

24550137	Title	MiR-503 targets PI3K p85 and IKK-β and suppresses progression of non-small cell lung cancer.
24550137	Abstract	A microRNA usually has the ability to coordinately repress multiple target genes and therefore are associated with many pathological conditions such as human cancer. Our understanding of the biological roles of microRNAs in lung cancer, however, remains incomplete. In this study, we identified miR-503 as a tumor-suppressive microRNA in human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), whose expression level correlates inversely with overall survival in NSCLC patients. Ectopic expression of miR-503 suppressed tumor cell proliferation and metastasis-related traits in vitro as well as in vivo, supporting a anti-cancer role of the microRNA in NSCLC progression. Mechanistic study revealed that oncogenic PI3K p85 and IKK-β were direct targets of miR-503. Overexpression of either PI3K p85 or IKK-β partially restored the malignant properties of NSCLC cells in the presence of miR-503. Taken together, our data demonstrate miR-503 inhibits the malignant phenotype of NSCLC by targeting PI3K p85 and IKK-β and might play a suppressive role in the pathogenesis of NSCLC, thus providing new insights in developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.

24551096	Title	MiR-141 suppresses the migration and invasion of HCC cells by targeting Tiam1.
24551096	Abstract	We have demonstrated that T lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (Tiam1) gene is associated with the poor prognosis of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and we used a computational approach to identify miR-141 as a Tiam1-targeting microRNA (miRNA). Here, we explored the function of miR-141 and the relationship between miR-141 and Tiam1 gene in HCC. The miR-141 expression in HCC tissues and cell lines was detected and its roles in regulation of HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion and target gene expression was investigated. Tiam1 was identified as a novel target of miR-141. Ethics statement: our study was approved by the Nanfang Hospital Medical Ethics Committee Ethics statement. Written informed consent was obtained before collection. Based on in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis, miR-141 was down-regulated in the same HCC samples. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with low miR-141 expression had poorer overall survival rate than that of the patients with high miR-141 expression. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that miR-141 could serve as an independent prognostic factor in HCC. MiR-141 significantly inhibited in vitro cell proliferation, migration and invasion as proved by gain- and loss- of function studies, while the mRNA and protein levels of Tiam1 were reduced in cells over-expressing miR-141. Moreover, Tiam1 treatment antagonized this effect, while knockdown of Tiam1 by Tiam1 short hairpin RNA (shTiam1) induced inhibitory effects. These findings indicated that miR-141 functions as a tumor suppressor and inhibits the migration and invasion of HCC cells by targeting Tiam1, which may provide novel prognostic and treatment strategies for HCC patients.

24552534	Title	miR-372 down-regulates the oncogene ATAD2 to influence hepatocellular carcinoma proliferation and metastasis.
24552534	Abstract	ATAD2 is associated with many cellular processes, such as cell growth, migration and invasion. However, no studies have been conducted on the molecular biological function of the ATAD2 gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The protein and mRNA level expression of ATAD2 was examined in tissues and cell lines. Prognostic significance was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier survival method and Cox regression. ATAD2 knockdown was used to analyze cell proliferation and invasion. The upstream and downstream of ATAD2 was analyzed by RT2 Profiler™ PCR array and luciferasex fluorescence system. ATAD2 was highly expressed in liver cancer samples and correlated with poor survival. High ATAD2 expression was positively correlated with metastasis (P = 0.005) and was an independent prognostic factor in HCC (P = 0.001). ATAD2 depletion by RNA interference reduced their capacity for invasion and proliferation and led to a G1 phase arrest in vitro. Further study revealed that miR-372 was an upstream target of ATAD2 as miR-372 was bound directly to its 3' untranslated region (3' UTR). In addition, ATAD2 knockdown was found to extremely up-regulate APC expression and down-regulate CTNNA1 at the mRNA level. The findings demonstrated that miR-372 suppressed the expression of ATAD2, which was highly expressed in HCC and exerted a proto-oncogene effect in hepatic carcinogenesis. In conclusion, ATAD2 may promote HCC progression.

24554664	Title	Inhibition of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus lytic replication by HIV-1 Nef and cellular microRNA hsa-miR-1258.
24554664	Abstract	Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is causally linked to several AIDS-related malignancies, including Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and multicentric Castleman's disease. The interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and KSHV has a central role in promoting the aggressive manifestations of AIDS-KS. We have previously shown that negative factor (Nef), a secreted HIV-1 protein, synergizes with KSHV viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6) to promote angiogenesis and tumorigenesis by activating the AKT pathway (X. Zhu, et al., Oncogene, 22 April 2013, http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/onc.2013.136). Here, we further demonstrated the role of soluble and ectopic Nef in the regulation of KSHV latency. We found that both soluble Nef protein and ectopic expression of Nef by transfection suppressed the expression of KSHV viral lytic mRNA transcripts and proteins and the production of infectious viral particles. MicroRNA (miRNA) microarray analysis identified a number of Nef-regulated miRNAs. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter analyses showed that one of the Nef-upregulated miRNAs, cellular miRNA 1258 (hsa-miR-1258), directly targeted a seed sequence in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA encoding the major lytic switch protein (RTA), which controls KSHV reactivation from latency. Ectopic expression of hsa-miR-1258 impaired RTA synthesis and enhanced Nef-mediated inhibition of KSHV replication, whereas repression of hsa-miR-1258 has the opposite effect. Mutation of the seed sequence in the RTA 3'UTR abolished downregulation of RTA by hsa-miR-1258. Collectively, these novel findings demonstrate that, by regulating cellular miRNA, Nef may inhibit KSHV replication to promote viral latency and contribute to the pathogenesis of AIDS-related malignancies. This study found that Nef, a secreted HIV-1 protein, suppressed KSHV lytic replication to promote KSHV latency. Mechanistic studies indicated that a Nef-upregulated cellular miRNA, hsa-miR-1258, inhibits KSHV replication by directly targeting a seed sequence in the KSHV RTA 3'UTR. These results illustrate that, in addition to viral miRNAs, cellular miRNAs also play an important role in regulating the life cycle of KSHV. Overall, this is the first study to report the involvement of Nef in KSHV latency, implying its likely important role in the pathogenesis of AIDS-related malignancies.

24555094	Title	Novel targets of miR-30, a microRNA required for biliary development.
24555094	Abstract	MicroRNAs have been found to play a profound role in embryonic and post-natal development through their regulation of processes such as cell proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis. The microRNA-30 (miR-30) family is necessary for vertebrate hepatobiliary development; however, the mechanism through which miR-30 regulates these processes is not fully understood. Here, we identify genes directly regulated by miR-30 that have been characterized as key developmental factors. The targets were confirmed via a luciferase reporter assay, following exogenous over-expression of miR-30a and miR-30c2 in cultured cells. Five novel miR-30ac2 targets were identified using this approach, all of which play crucial roles in hepatobiliary development or are involved in hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. 

24555885	Title	MiR-378 is an independent prognostic factor and inhibits cell growth and invasion in colorectal cancer.
24555885	Abstract	MicroRNAs(miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that participate in a variety of biologic processes, and dysregulation of miRNA is always associated with cancer development and progression. Aberrant expression of miR-378 has been found in some types of cancer. However, effects and potential mechanisms of miR-378 in colorectal cancer (CRC) have not been explored. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to evaluate miR-378 levels in CRC cell lines and 84 pairs of CRC cancer and normal adjacent mucosa. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional regression analyses were utilized to determine the association of miR-378 expression with survival of patients. MTT and invasion assays were used to determine the role of miR-378 in regulation of CRC cancer cell growth and invasion, respectively. Tumor growth was assessed by subcutaneous inoculation of cells into BALB/c nude mice. Luciferase assay was performed to assess miR-378 binding to vimentin gene. In this study, we confirmed that miR-378 significantly down-regulated in CRC cancer tissues and cell lines. Moreover, patients with low miR-378 expression had significantly poorer overall survival, and miR-378 expression was an independent prognostic factor in CRC. Over-expression of miR-378 inhibited SW620 cell growth and invasion, and resulted in down-regulation of vimentin expression. However, miR-378 knock-down promoted these processes and enhanced the expression of vimentin. In addition, we further identified vimentin as the functional downstream target of miR-378 by directly targeting the 3'-UTR of vimentin. In conclusion, miR-378 may function as a tumor suppressor and plays an important role in inhibiting tumor growth and invasion. Our present results implicate the potential effects of miR-378 on prognosis and treatment of CRC cancer.

24556500	Title	Mature miR-183, negatively regulated by transcription factor GATA3, promotes 3T3-L1 adipogenesis through inhibition of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by targeting LRP6.
24556500	Abstract	Differentiation of preadipocytes into adipocytes and the formation of the subsequent adipose tissue are critical for mammalian growth and development. The molecular mechanism relating to preadipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis from the perspective of miRNAs is not yet completely understood. Here we investigated whether miR-183 functioned in the differentiation process. Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays demonstrated that miR-183 positively regulated 3T3-L1 differentiation by enhancing the expression of adipogenic marker genes such as CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), adiponectin and fatty acid synthase (FAS), as well as the triglyceride content and accumulation of lipid droplets. Meanwhile, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) was known to impair the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and thereafter reduce c-myc and nuclear β-catenin protein. We showed that the inhibition of LRP6 by siRNA promoted 3T3-L1 adipogenic differentiation and adipogenesis. Further analysis showed that mouse miR-183 gene had its own transcription unit containing CpG islands, transcription start site (TSS), coding sequence (CDS) and polyA signal within the flanking sequences 2500 nt upstream and downstream of mouse miR-183 in genome. The core promoter of miR-183 gene was identified and transcription factor GATA3 (GATA binding protein 3) significantly inhibited the expression of mature miR-183 by binding to its core promoter in vivo, as indicated by the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. These results suggest that miR-183, though negatively regulated by transcription factor GATA3, enhances 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation and adipogenesis through the inhibition of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway by targeting LRP6.

24556602	Title	MicroRNA-27a promotes proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting MAP2K4 in human osteosarcoma cells.
24556602	Abstract	Osteosarcoma is a high-grade malignant bone neoplasm. Although the introduction of chemotherapy has reduced its mortality, more than 50% of patients develop chemoresistance and have an extremely poor prognosis due to pulmonary metastasis. Several molecular pathways contributing to osteosarcoma development and progression have recently been discovered. Various studies have addressed the genes involved in the metastasis of osteosarcoma. However, the highly complex molecular mechanisms of metastasis are still poorly understood. Recently, the decisive role of microRNAs in the regulation of molecular pathways has been uncovered. miRNAs may function as either oncogenes or tumor suppressors, depending on their target genes. miR-27a, a member of an evolutionarily conserved miRNA family, is abnormally increased in several types of cancers. It has been shown to be upregulated in osteosarcoma and plays a pro-metastatic role in osteosarcoma cell lines. However, the effects of miR-27a on osteosarcoma have not been clearly elucidated. The present study thus addressed the miR-27a sensitive mechanisms in osteosarcoma. In this study, three biological programs were used to predict whether MAP2K4 was a target of miR-27a. A specific miR-27a inhibitor was used to inhibit the endogenous activity of miR-27a in the human osteosarcoma cell line MG63. Cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion assays were performed to assess the effects of miR-27a on the proliferation, metastasis and invasion of MG63 cells. The expression levels of several proteins evolved in the JNK/p38 signaling pathway were detected using western blot analysis. The luciferase activity of the wild-type pGL3-MAP2K4 3'UTR vector was significantly inhibited after the miR-27a precursor or the control precursor was transfected into the MG63 cells. However, the luciferase activity was not inhibited after transfection of the mutant pGL3-MAP2K4 3'UTR vector. The inhibition of miR-27a increased the luciferase activity of the wild-type pGL3-MAP2K4 3'UTR vector after MG63 cells were transfected with the miR-27a inhibitor or the control inhibitor. Thus, MAP2K4 is a potential target of miR-27a and can be directly regulated by miR-27a. Inhibition of miR-27a significantly suppressed cell proliferation after 72 hours compared to the negative control group. Inhibition of miR-27a significantly suppressed colony formation of the MG63 cells by 39 6%. Transwell migration and invasion assays demonstrated that the number of migratory and invasive cells transfected with the miR-27a inhibitor was reduced by 63.5% and 69.1%, respectively. After transfection of the miR-27a inhibitor into the MG63 cells, the level of phospho-JNK1 and phospho-p38 increased by 25% and 29%, respectively, along with the up-regulation of MAP2K4 protein. This is the first study showing that miR-27a can function as an oncogene by targeting MAP2K4 in the osteosarcoma MG63 cell line. Inhibition of miR-27a increases MAP2K4 expression, which in turn inhibits cell proliferation and migration through the JNK/p38 signaling pathway in MG63 cells. These findings may help us understand the molecular mechanism of miR-27a in the tumorigenesis of osteosarcoma and may provide new diagnostic and therapeutic options for the treatment of this neoplasia.

24556800	Title	MiR-4782-3p inhibited non-small cell lung cancer growth via USP14.
24556800	Abstract	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with near 1.4 million deaths each year. NSCLC accounts for nearly 85% of all case of lung cancer. MiRNAs play important roles in regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. MiRNAs profiles may predict prognosis and disease recurrence in early-stage NSCLC. Our previous study proved that over-expression of ubiquitin specific peptidase 14 (USP14), a deubiquitinating enzyme, was associated with favorable prognosis in NSCLC patients and promoted tumor cells proliferation. Here, we tried to identify which miRNAs targeted USP14, and the roles of these miRNAs in NSCLC. MiR-4782-3p and its potential targeted genes were identified by bioinformatics algorithm. Dual luciferase reporter assay system was used to analyze the interaction between miR-4782-3p and targeted genes. Cell proliferation was assayed by MTT and BdU assay. MiRNAs and mRNA expression were assayed by qRT-PCR. USP14 protein level was assayed by Western blot. The role of miR-4782-3p in patients survival was revealed by Kaplan-Meier plot of overall survival. Up-expression of miR-4782-3p in NSCLC cells decreased the USP14 expression. Down-expression of miR-4782-3p increased USP14 expression. In NSCLC specimen, Negative correlation between USP14 mRNA level and miR-4782-3p level was identified. Higher miR-4782-3p expression is associated with longer survival. USP14, ZEB2, XIAP overexpression reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-4782-3p. High expression of miR-4782-3p was associated with favorable prognosis in NSCLC patients. MiR-4782-3p inhibited cell proliferation in NSCLC by targeting USP14, ZEB2 and XIAP.

24557880	Title	The long noncoding RNA CHRF regulates cardiac hypertrophy by targeting miR-489.
24557880	Abstract	Sustained cardiac hypertrophy is often accompanied by maladaptive cardiac remodeling leading to decreased compliance and increased risk for heart failure. Maladaptive hypertrophy is considered to be a therapeutic target for heart failure. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have various biological functions and have been extensively investigated in past years. We identified miR-489 and lncRNAs (cardiac hypertrophy related factor, CHRF) from hypertrophic cardiomyocytes. Here, we tested the hypothesis that miR-489 and CHRF can participate in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. A microarray was performed to analyze miRNAs in response to angiotensin II treatment, and we found miR-489 was substantially reduced. Enforced expression of miR-489 in cardiomyocytes and transgenic overexpression of miR-489 both exhibited reduced hypertrophic response on angiotensin II treatment. We identified myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (Myd88) as a miR-489 target to mediate the function of miR-489 in cardiac hypertrophy. Knockdown of Myd88 in cardiomyocytes and Myd88-knockout mice both showed attenuated hypertrophic responses. Furthermore, we explored the molecular mechanism by which miR-489 expression is regulated and found that an lncRNA that we named CHRF acts as an endogenous sponge of miR-489, which downregulates miR-489 expression levels. CHRF is able to directly bind to miR-489 and regulate Myd88 expression and hypertrophy. Our present study reveals a novel cardiac hypertrophy regulating model that is composed of CHRF, miR-489, and Myd88. The modulation of their levels may provide a new approach for tackling cardiac hypertrophy.

24558106	Title	Deficiency of the microRNA-31-microRNA-720 pathway in the plasma and endothelial progenitor cells from patients with coronary artery disease.
24558106	Abstract	Defects in angiogenesis/vasculogenesis or vessel repair are major complications of coronary artery disease (CAD). Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) play a fundamental role in postnatal vascular repair and CAD. The role of microRNAs in CAD pathogenesis and their potential as biomarkers remain to be elucidated. MicroRNA-31 (miR-31) level in both the plasma and EPCs of patients with CAD is found lower. miR-31 regulates EPC activities by targeting FAT atypical cadherin 4 and thromboxane A2 receptor, which show increased expression in CAD EPCs. Overexpressing miR-31 in CAD EPCs rescued their angiogenic and vasculogenic abilities both in vitro and in vivo. When exploring approaches to restore endogenous miR-31, we found that far-infrared treatment enhanced the expression of not only miR-31, but also miR-720 in CAD EPCs. miR-720, which was also decreased in EPCs and the plasma of patients with CAD, stimulated EPC activity by targeting vasohibin 1. The miR720-vasohibin 1 pair was shown to be downstream of FAT atypical cadherin 4, but not of thromboxane A2 receptor. FAT atypical cadherin 4 inhibited miR-720 expression via repression of the planar cell polarity signaling gene four-jointed box 1 (FJX1), which was required for miR-720 expression through a hypoxia-inducible factor 1, α subunit-dependent mechanism. Restoring miR-720 level strengthened activity of CAD EPCs. The miR-31-miR-720 pathway is shown critical to EPC activation and that downregulation of this pathway contributes to CAD pathogenesis. Circulating levels of miR-31, miR-720, and vasohibin 1 have the potential to allow early diagnosis of CAD and to act as prognosis biomarkers for CAD and other EPC-related diseases. Manipulating the expression of the miR-31-miR-720 pathway in malfunction EPCs should help develop novel therapeutic modalities.

24558412	Title	Ischemic preconditioning potentiates the protective effect of stem cells through secretion of exosomes by targeting Mecp2 via miR-22.
24558412	Abstract	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have potential application for the treatment of ischemic heart diseases. Besides differentiation properties, MSCs protect ischemic cardiomyocytes by secretion of paracrine factors. In this study, we found exosomes enriched with miR-22 were secreted by MSCs following ischemic preconditioning (Exo(IPC)) and mobilized to cardiomyocytes where they reduced their apoptosis due to ischemia. Interestingly, by time-lapse imaging, we for the first time captured the dynamic shedding of miR-22 loaded exosomes from cytosol to extracellular space. Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic effect of miR-22 was mediated by direct targeting of methyl CpG binding protein 2 (Mecp2). In vivo data showed that delivery of Exo(IPC) significantly reduced cardiac fibrosis. Our data identified a significant benefit of Exo(IPC) for the treatment of cardiac diseases by targeting Mecp2 via miR-22.

24558429	Title	Mir-184 post-transcriptionally regulates SOX7 expression and promotes cell proliferation in human hepatocellular carcinoma.
24558429	Abstract	Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common human malignancies and the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. The development and progression of HCC is a complicated process, involving the deregulation of multiple genes that are essential to cell biological processes. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested to be closely associated with tumorigenesis. Our study showed that miR-184 is upregulated in HCC cell lines and tissues. Overexpression of miR-184 in HCC cells increased cell proliferation, tumorigenicity, and cell cycle progression, whereas inhibition of miR-184 reduced cell proliferation, tumorigenicity, and cell cycle progression. Additionally, we identified SOX7 as a direct target of miR-184. Ectopic expression of miR-184 led to downregulation of the SOX7 protein, resulting in upregulation of c-Myc, Cyclin D1, and phosphorylation of Rb. Our findings suggested that miR-184 represents a potential onco-miR and plays an important role in HCC progression by suppressing SOX7 expression.

24559209	Title	Chemokine receptor CCR6 expression is regulated by miR-518a-5p in colorectal cancer cells.
24559209	Abstract	Recently, involvement of the chemokine/receptor system CCL20/CCR6 in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression was shown. Here, we analyzed the functional interaction of miRNA-518-5p (miR-518a-5p) with CCR6 and its impact on CCR6 expression in CRC cells. MiR-518a-5p was identified by computer software to potentially interact with CCR6. Hence, functional implications of miR-518a-5p with the 3'UTR of CCR6 were analyzed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter assay system. Confirmation of the predicted target site for miR-518a-5p was achieved by site-directed mutagenesis of the seed sequence in the 3'UTR of CCR6 and subsequent application of the mutated seed sequence in a luciferase assay with miR-518a-5p mimics. Accordingly, two CRC cell lines (Caco-2 and HT-29) were transfected with miR-518a-5p miRNA mimics and gene and protein expression of CCR6 was monitored using qRT PCR and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Addition of miR-518a-5p led to significant down-regulation of luciferase activity (P < 0.05), which was significantly reversed in a reporter test system containing the mutated seed sequences in the 3'UTR of CCR6. Following transfection of CRC cell lines with miR-518a-5p mimics and subsequent monitoring of CCR6 expression showed significant down-regulation of CCR6 mRNA and CCR6 protein expression in both CRC cell lines under investigation (P < 0.05). We have shown that miR-518a-5p functionally interacts with CCR6 and that transfection of CRC cells with miR-518a-5p leads to significant CCR6 down-regulation. Consequently, CCR6 expression is regulated by miR-518a-5p in CRC cells indicating that regulation of CCR6 expression by miR-518a-5p might be a regulatory mechanism involved in CRC pathogenesis.

24559685	Title	Downregulation of HOXA1 gene affects small cell lung cancer cell survival and chemoresistance under the regulation of miR-100.
24559685	Abstract	Chemoresistance is often developed in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients and leads to poor prognosis. Hox genes, a highly conserved family, play a crucial role in apoptosis, receptor signalling and differentiation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have also been shown to play a crucial role in these biological processes by regulating the target genes. Several studies reported that both Hox genes and miRNAs are involved in chemoresistance. The aim of our study is to characterise the clinical significance and functional roles of HOXA1 in SCLC. Expression of HOXA1 was examined in 63 cases of SCLC tissues and 29 cases of blood by immunohistochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) methods. Multivariate analysis confirmed the prognostic significance of HOXA1 in SCLC patients. Restoration of HOXA1 expression was carried out in SCLC multidrug resistant cell line H69AR and its parental cell line H69 to assess its influence on chemoresistance. Luciferase reporter assay was used to assess HOXA1 as a target of miR-100. The results showed that HOXA1 was expressed in 46% (29/63) of SCLC. Low HOXA1 expression was associated with the poor prognosis of SCLC (P<0.05 by the Fisher's Exact Test) and the shorter survival rate (P<0.001 by the Kaplan-Meier method). HOXA1 expression on both mRNA and protein levels significantly correlated with chemotherapy response. Enforced expression of HOXA1 in resistant H69AR cells led to increased chemosensitivity through increasing cell apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. Inhibition of HOXA1 expression using HOXA1 siRNA in H69 cells resulted in cell resistance to therapeutic drugs through reducing drug-induced cell apoptosis accompanied with cell cycle arrest. Expression of endogenous miR-100 was significantly elevated in resistant H69AR cells and negatively related with HOXA1 expression. The expression of HOXA1 in SCLC tissues correlated inversely with the expression levels of miR-100. Reporter assays confirmed that miR-100 targeted predicted sites in 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of HOXA1 gene. Our data suggested that HOXA1-mediated SCLC chemoresistance is under the regulation of miR-100. HOXA1 may be a prognostic predictor and potential therapeutic target in human SCLC.

24560136	Title	Down-regulation of miR-34a alleviates mesangial proliferation in vitro and glomerular hypertrophy in early diabetic nephropathy mice by targeting GAS1.
24560136	Abstract	Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major diabetic complication characterized by mesangial proliferation and glomerular hypertrophy. MicroRNAs might play an important role in these pathological processes. The aim of this study is to examine the possible association of miR-34a as one of the microRNAs with DN and underlying mechanisms in vitro and in vivo. According to previous results of microarray which compared the different microRNAs between diabetic and normal control mice, miR-34a was chosen and its expression was detected by qRT-PCR. Cell viability was then assessed using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) and 5-ethynyl-20-deoxyuridine (EDU) incorporation. Antagomir was injected in db/db mice to down regulate miR-34a. Average diameter of glomeruli was analyzed by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain of kidney. Luciferase gene report assay was then performed to identify the target gene of miR-34a. Additional immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analyses were implemented to verify the expression level of growth arrest-specific 1 (GAS1). MiR-34a expression level was increased under high glucose condition in vitro and in vivo. Down-regulation of miR-34a inhibits mice mesangial cells (MMCs) proliferation in vitro and alleviates glomerular hypertrophy in vivo. GAS1 was proved to be the target of miR-34a through luciferase report. Moreover, up-regulation of GAS1 expression was observed in the presence of miR-34a antagomir as compared with miR-34a antagomir-NC in high-glucose-treated MMCs and db/db mice, respectively. MiR-34a regulated mesangial proliferation and glomerular hypertrophy by directly inhibiting GAS1 in early DN.

24563321	Title	Effect of miR-205 on 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation through targeting to glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta.
24563321	Abstract	MiR-205 plays an important role during adipogenesis by modulating the Wnt signaling pathway. Here, we report that miR-205 can regulate the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cells by targeting glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β), which is a negative regulatory factor of Wnt signaling. When transiently overexpressed in 3T3-L1 cells, miR-205 suppressed the translation of GSK-3β, resulting in increased expression of β-catenin, which can promote cell proliferation by facilitating the transcription of the Wnt target genes cyclin D1 and c-Myc. However, stable overexpression of miR-205 in 3T3-L1 cells did not show any apparent inhibitory effect on adipogenic differentiation. While endogenous miR-205 was inhibited in 3T3-L1 cells, the adipogenesis marker gene, C/EBPα, was significantly activated and more lipid droplets appeared in differentiated adipocytes. However, systemic silencing of miR-205 in mice by using a locked-nucleic-acid-modified oligonucleotide (LNA-antimiR) did not lead to any observable increase in adipose tissue differentiation, implying that, as opposed to the findings from 3T3-L1 cells, miR-205 is dispensable for adipose tissue development in mice.

24565101	Title	MicroRNA-26b suppresses the NF-κB signaling and enhances the chemosensitivity of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by targeting TAK1 and TAB3.
24565101	Abstract	Abnormal activation of the NF-κB pathway is closely related to tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. Therefore, microRNAs that possess the NF-κB inhibitory activity may provide novel targets for anti-cancer therapy. miR-26 family members have been shown to be frequently downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and correlated with the poor survival of HCC patients. To date, there is no report disclosing the regulatory role of miR-26 on the NF-κB pathway and its biological significance. The effects of miR-26b on the NF-κB signaling pathway and the chemosensitivity of cancer cells were examined in two HCC cell lines, QGY-7703 and MHCC-97H, using both gain- and loss-of-function studies. The correlation between miR-26b level and apoptosis rate was further investigated in clinical HCC specimens. Both TNFα and doxorubicin treatment activated the NF-κB signaling pathway in HCC cells. However, the restoration of miR-26b expression significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of IκBα and p65, blocked the nuclear translocation of NF-κB, reduced the NF-κB reporter activity, and consequently abrogated the expression of NF-κB target genes in TNFα or doxorubicin-treated HCC cells. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of miR-26b dramatically sensitized HCC cells to the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, whereas the antagonism of miR-26b attenuated cell apoptosis. Consistently, the miR-26b level was positively correlated with the apoptosis rate in HCC tissues. Subsequent investigations revealed that miR-26b inhibited the expression of TAK1 and TAB3, two positive regulators of NF-κB pathway, by binding to their 3'-untranslated region. Moreover, knockdown of TAK1 or TAB3 phenocopied the effects of miR-26b overexpression. These data suggest that miR-26b suppresses NF-κB signaling and thereby sensitized HCC cells to the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of TAK1 and TAB3. Our findings highlight miR-26b as a potent inhibitor of the NF-κB pathway and an attractive target for cancer treatment.

24565525	Title	Hyaluronic acid-chitosan nanoparticles for co-delivery of MiR-34a and doxorubicin in therapy against triple negative breast cancer.
24565525	Abstract	Metastatic relapse, development of drug resistance in cancer cells and adverse side effects of chemotherapeutic agents are the major obstacles for effective chemotherapy against triple-negative breast cancer. To address these problems, miR-34a, a potent endogenous tumor suppressive molecule in breast cancer, was co-encapsulated with doxorubicin (DOX) into hyaluronic acid (HA)-chitosan (CS) nanoparticles (NPs) and simultaneously delivered into breast cancer cells for improved therapeutic effects of drug. DOX-miR-34a co-loaded HA-CS NPs were successfully prepared through ionotropic gelation method in water. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that miR-34a and DOX can be efficiently encapsulated into HA-CS NPs and delivered into tumor cells or tumor tissues and enhance anti-tumor effects of DOX by suppressing the expression of non-pump resistance and anti-apoptosis proto-oncogene Bcl-2. In addition, intracellular restoration of miR-34a inhibited breast cancer cell migration via targeting Notch-1 signaling. The obtained data suggest that co-delivery of DOX and miR-34a could achieve synergistic effects on tumor suppression and nanosystem-based co-delivery of tumor suppressive miRNAs and chemotherapeutic agents may be a promising combined therapeutic strategy for enhanced anti-tumor therapy.

24565840	Title	Effects of miR-31 on the osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells.
24565840	Abstract	Exploring the molecular mechanisms that regulate the osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) will bring us more efficient methods for improving the treatment of bone-related diseases. In this study, we analyzed the effects of miR-31 on the osteogenesis of hMSCs. The overexpression of miR-31 repressed the osteogenesis of hMSCs, whereas the downregulation enhanced this process. SATB2 was testified to be a direct target of miR-31, and its effects on the osteogenesis were also described. Most importantly, the knockdown of SATB2 attenuated miR-31's osteogenic effects. Taken together, our findings suggest that miR-31 regulates the osteogenesis of hMSCs by targeting SATB2.

24569834	Title	miR-29b as a therapeutic agent for angiotensin II-induced cardiac fibrosis by targeting TGF-β/Smad3 signaling.
24569834	Abstract	Loss of miR-29 is associated with cardiac fibrosis. This study examined the role and therapeutic potential of miR-29 in mouse model of hypertension induced by angiotensin II (AngII). By using microRNA microarray, in situ hybridization, and real-time polymerase chain reaction, we found that AngII-induced cardiac fibrosis in the hypertensive heart and in cultured cardiac fibroblasts were associated with downregulation of miR-29a-c via a Smad3-dependent mechanism. In vitro knockdown of miR-29b enhanced but overexpression of miR-29b inhibited AngII-induced fibrosis, revealing a protective role of miR-29b in cardiac fibrosis in response to AngII. This was further demonstrated in vivo by the ability of overexpressing miR-29b in the mouse heart to prevent AngII-mediated cardiac fibrosis and cardiac dysfunction. Importantly, we also found that restored miR-29b in the established hypertensive heart was capable of blocking progressive cardiac fibrosis and improving cardiac dysfunction, demonstrating a therapeutic potential of miR-29b for chronic heart disease. Further studies revealed that targeting the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 coding sequence region, thereby inhibiting TGF-β/Smad3 signaling, could be a new mechanism by which miR-29b inhibited AngII-induced cardiac fibrosis. In conclusion, miR-29b plays a protective role in AngII-mediated cardiac remodeling and may be a therapeutic agent for cardiac fibrosis by targeting the TGF-β/Smad3 pathway.

24570594	Title	miR-7 inhibits colorectal cancer cell proliferation and induces apoptosis by targeting XRCC2.
24570594	Abstract	Analysis using publicly available algorithms predicts that X-ray repair complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 2 (XRCC2), a key component in the homologous recombination repair pathway, is a potential target of micro-ribonucleic acid-7 (miR-7). Some studies have shown that both miR-7 and XRCC2 are associated with cancer development. For this purpose, we searched for the possible relationship between miR-7 and XRCC2 in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). miR-7 expression was assessed in CRC specimens and cell lines using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm the target associations. The effect of miR-7 on cell proliferation and apoptosis was confirmed in vitro by the methylthiazol tetrazolium (MTT) assay, colony formation assay, and flow cytometry. Gene and protein expression were examined using real time PCR and western blotting, respectively. miR-7 was downregulated in CRC specimens and cell lines, and targeted the 3' untranslated region of XRCC2. miR-7 overexpression reduced cyclin D1 expression and increased p21, caspase-3, and BAX expression, which subsequently inhibited CRC cell proliferation and induced CRC cell apoptosis. However, XRCC2 can repress the inhibitory effects of miR-7 on proliferation. Our findings suggest that miR-7 plays a protective role by inhibiting proliferation and increasing apoptosis of CRC cells. It may identify new targets for anti-cancer treatment.

24571667	Title	NF-kappaB-dependent microRNA-425 upregulation promotes gastric cancer cell growth by targeting PTEN upon IL-1Beta induction.
24571667	Abstract	Overexpression of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1Beta is associated with diverse diseases, including cancer. Alteration of microRNAs has been observed in cancer cells exposed to proinflammatory cytokines, yet their function in inflammation stress remains elusive. Here, we show that IL-1Beta induces the upregulation of miR-425, which negatively regulates phosphatase and tensin homolog expression by targeting its 3' UTR. An increase in miR-425 depends on IL-1Beta-induced NF-kappaB activation, which enhances miR-425 gene transcription upon IL-1Beta induction. Consequently, repression of phosphatase and tensin homolog by miR-425 promotes gastric cancer cell proliferation, which is required to protect cells from cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our data support a critical role for NF-kappaB-dependent upregulation of miR-425, which represents a new pathway for the repression of phosphatase and tensin homolog activation and the promotion of cell survival upon IL-1Beta induction.

24571711	Title	Epigenetic silencing of miR-375 induces trastuzumab resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer by targeting IGF1R.
24571711	Abstract	Resistance to humanized monoclonal erbB2/HER2 antibody, trastuzumab (Herceptin), has become a pivotal obstacle for targeted therapy of HER2-positive breast cancers. The activation of alternative growth factor receptors, in particular, the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R), represents a common feature of trastuzumab-refractory cells; however, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer SKBr-3 cells were generated by long-term in vitro culture of SKBr-3 cells in the presence of trastuzumab. Among the differentially expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) screened by microarray analysis, candidate miRNA(s) predicted to target IGF1R was studied for its role in conferring trastuzumab resistance. The mechanism underlying decreased expression of IGF1R-targeted miRNA in refractory cells was also addressed. miR-375, which was downregulated and predicted to target IGF1R in trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer cells, could indeed inhibit the cellular luciferase activity in a reporter construct containing the 3'-UTR of IGF1R. Overexpression of miR-375 restored the sensitivity of cells to trastuzumab, while inhibition of miR-375 conferred trastuzumab resistance on HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Blockade of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation restored the expression of miR-375 in trastuzumab-resistant cells. A reverse correlation between the levels of miR-375 and IGF1R was validated in clinical breast cancers. Epigenetic silencing of miR-375 causes the upregulation of IGF1R, which at least partially underlies trastuzumab resistance of breast cancer cells. Our study has implications for miR-375 as a potential target in combination with trastuzumab for treating HER2-positive breast cancers.

24572141	Title	Epigenetic modification of MiR-429 promotes liver tumour-initiating cell properties by targeting Rb binding protein 4.
24572141	Abstract	Liver tumour-initiating cells (T-ICs) are critical for hepatocarcinogenesis. However, the underlying mechanism regulating the function of liver T-ICs remains unclear. Tissue microarrays containing 242 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples were used for prognostic analysis. Magnetically activated cell sorting was used to isolate epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM)-positive cells. The gene expressions affected by miR-429 were determined by arrays. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to study interactions among retinoblastoma protein (RB1), Rb binding protein 4 (RBBP4) and E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1). The DNA methylation status in CpG islands was detected by quantitative methylation analysis. miRNAs in microvesicles were isolated by a syringe filter system. The significant prognosis factor miR-429 was upregulated in HCC tissues and also in primary liver T-ICs isolated from clinical samples. The enrichment of miR-429 in EPCAM+ T-ICs contributed to hepatocyte self-renewal, malignant proliferation, chemoresistance and tumorigenicity. A novel functional axis involving miR-429, RBBP4, E2F1 and POU class 5 homeobox 1 (POU5F1 or OCT4) governing the regulation of liver EPCAM+ T-ICs was established in vitro and in vivo. The molecular mechanism regulating miR-429 expression, involving four abnormal hypomethylated sites upstream of the miR-200b/miR-200a/miR-429 cluster, was first defined in both EPCAM+ liver T-ICs and very early-stage HCC tissues. miR-429 secreted by high-expressing cells has the potential to become a proactive signalling molecule to mediate intercellular communication. Epigenetic modification of miR-429 can manipulate liver T-ICs by targeting the RBBP4/E2F1/OCT4 axis. This miRNA might be targeted to inactivate T-ICs, thus providing a novel strategy for HCC prevention and treatment.

24573236	Title	miR-1236-3p represses the cell migration and invasion abilities by targeting ZEB1 in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma.
24573236	Abstract	Ovarian cancer, particularly high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HG-SOC), is still the main cause of death among gynecological malignancies. However, the molecular mechanisms related to its malignant biological behavior are still unclear. Recent studies indicate that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in tumor metastasis. Here, we report that miR-1236-3p expression was downregulated in HG-SOC when compared to that in normal fallopian tube tissue. Manipulation of miR-1236-3p significantly influenced the morphology, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cell lines (A2780 and SKOV3). With dual-luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated that miR‑1236-3p binds to the 3'UTR of zinc-finger E-box binding homeobox 1 (ZEB1) mRNA, and functions as a negative regulator of ZEB1. Furthermore, we revealed that manipulation of miR-1236-3p modulates ZEB1 expression and influences expression of its downstream genes E-cadherin and N-cadherin at both the mRNA and protein levels. We also found an inverse relationship between miR‑1236-3p and ZEB1 expression in the HG-SOC tissue samples. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-1236-3p regulates ovarian cancer metastasis by directly targeting ZEB1, and it may play an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of ovarian cancer.

24573354	Title	MicroRNA-10b promotes migration and invasion through KLF4 and HOXD10 in human bladder cancer.
24573354	Abstract	The present study was performed to investigate the effect of microRNA-10b (miR-10b) on cell migration and invasion in human bladder cancer (BC). Real-time PCR was performed to detect the expression of miR-10b in BC cell lines. miR-10b mimics, the negative control for mimics, miR-10b inhibitor and the negative control for inhibitor were transfected into BC cell lines and the effects of miR-10b on the migration and invasion of cells were investigated through Transwell assay. Meanwhile, protein levels of KLF4, HOXD10, E-cadherin and MMP14 were measured. Luciferase assays were also performed to validate KLF4 and HOXD10 as miR-10b targets. In vivo metastasis assay was performed to validate if miR-10b can promote BC cell line metastasis in vivo. miR-10b is significantly upregulated in BC cell lines and metastatic tissues. Increased miR-10b expression significantly enhanced BC cell migration and invasion, while decreased miR-10b expression reduced cell migration and invasion. In vivo metastasis assay demonstrated that overexpression of miR-10b markedly promoted BC metastasis. Moreover, KLF4 and HOXD10 were identified as direct targets of miR-10b in BC cells. Silencing of KLF4 or HOXD10 recapitulated the pro-metastatic function. Furthermore, we found that E-cadherin and MMP14 may be the downstream factors of KLF4 and HOXD10 in the suppression of BC metastasis by miR-10b. These data suggest that miR-10b may function as oncogenes in BC cells. Targeting these novel strategies, inhibition of miR-10b/KLF4/E-cadherin axis and miR-10b/HOXD10/MMP14 axis may be helpful as a therapeutic approach to block BC cell metastasis.

24573489	Title	miR-7 inhibits the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer cells by suppressing epidermal growth factor receptor expression.
24573489	Abstract	The present study profiled differentially expressed microRNAs (miRs) in gastric cancer cell lines and then investigated miR-7 expression in gastric cancer tissue specimens and the effects of miR-7 on the growth, invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer cells and the underlying molecular events. A microRNA microarray was used to profile differentially expressed miRNAs in human gastric cancer cell lines relative to a normal stomach mucosal epithelial cell line. The miRNA miR-7 was selected for further investigation, which included real-time reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of miR-7 levels in different gastric cancer cell lines and tissues and distant non-tumor tissues from patient resections. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), Transwell migration and invasion, and western blot assays were performed to assess tumor cell viability, invasion and gene expression, respectively, after miR-7 transfection. The miRNA microarray profiling revealed 14 upregulated miRNAs (including miR-21, miR-26b and miR-30b) and 19 downregulated miRNAs (including let-7i, miR-7 and miR-622) between gastric cancer and normal cell lines. The qRT-PCR analysis confirmed that reduced miR-7 expression occurred more frequently in poorly and moderately differentiated gastric cancer MGC-803, MKN-45 and SGC-7901 cell lines than in the well-differentiated gastric cancer NCI-N87 cell line, which was consistent with the results for gastric cancer tissues. Expression of miR-7 was downregulated in 86.9% (20/23) of the gastric cancer tissues compared with that in the distant non-tumor tissues. Restoration of miR-7 expression significantly inhibited tumor cell viability, invasiveness and migration when compared with the control cells. Luciferase assay confirmed the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a target gene of mR-7, and expression of miR-7 significantly suppressed EGFR expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. The data from the present study demonstrated that reduced miR-7 expression contributes to gastric cancer development and progression. Further study will investigate miR-7 in the regulation of EGFR expression in vitro and in vivo.

24573637	Title	miR-181 subunits enhance the chemosensitivity of temozolomide by Rap1B-mediated cytoskeleton remodeling in glioblastoma cells.
24573637	Abstract	Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most malignant and frequent brain tumor, with an aggressive growth pattern and poor prognosis despite best treatment modalities. Although chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ) may restrain tumor growth for some months, TMZ resistance is also common and accounts for many treatment failures. Research into microRNA's role in GBM has shown that microRNAs play a key regulatory role in the GBM, making it a potential therapeutic target. In this study, we demonstrated that the lower expression of miR-181a/b/c/d subunits contributes to astrocytoma tumorigenesis, and their overexpression could inhibit the invasive proliferation of glioblastoma cells by targeting Rap1B-mediated cytoskeleton remodeling and related molecular (Cdc42, RhoA and N-cadherin) changes, suggesting that miR-181 was a critical regulator and might be an important target for glioblastoma treatment. TMZ as a standard chemotherapeutic agent for GBM inhibited the Rap1B expression and actin cytoskeleton remodeling to exert its cell killing by upregulating miR-181a/b/c/d subunits; conversely, each miR-181a/b/c/d subunit enhanced the chemosensitivity of TMZ in glioblastoma cells.

24573672	Title	MicroRNA-137 is a novel hypoxia-responsive microRNA that inhibits mitophagy via regulation of two mitophagy receptors FUNDC1 and NIX.
24573672	Abstract	Mitophagy receptors mediate the selective recognition and targeting of damaged mitochondria by autophagosomes. The mechanism for the regulation of these receptors remains unknown. Here, we demonstrated that a novel hypoxia-responsive microRNA, microRNA-137 (miR-137), markedly inhibits mitochondrial degradation by autophagy without affecting global autophagy. miR-137 targets the expression of two mitophagy receptors NIX and FUNDC1. Impaired mitophagy in response to hypoxia caused by miR-137 is reversed by re-expression of FUNDC1 and NIX expression vectors lacking the miR-137 recognition sites at their 3' UTR. Conversely, miR-137 also suppresses the mitophagy induced by fundc1 (CDS+3'UTR) but not fundc1 (CDS) overexpression. Finally, we found that miR-137 inhibits mitophagy by reducing the expression of the mitophagy receptor thereby leads to inadequate interaction between mitophagy receptor and LC3. Our results demonstrated the regulatory role of miRNA to mitophagy receptors and revealed a novel link between miR-137 and mitophagy.

24574214	Title	MicroRNA-451 down-regulates neutrophil chemotaxis via p38 MAPK.
24574214	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that regulate the activity of target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and cellular processes. MicroRNA-451 (miR-451) is one of the miRNAs that is conserved perfectly among vertebrates, and it regulates cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis in tumors. However, the role of miR-451 in autoimmune arthritis is unknown. This study was undertaken to identify the role of miR-451 in autoimmune arthritis. We compared the expression of miR-451 in neutrophils from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy controls. We also evaluated the role of miR-451 in neutrophil chemotaxis in vivo and in vitro using murine neutrophils. The regulation of p38 MAPK by miR-451 was assessed. Double-stranded miR-451 was administered to SKG mice, the arthritis score was determined, and histologic examination was performed. MicroRNA-451 expression in neutrophils isolated from patients with RA was lower than that in healthy controls. Systemic administration of miR-451 significantly disrupted the infiltration of neutrophils in an air-pouch model of local inflammation without affecting apoptosis of neutrophils. Overexpression of miR-451 significantly suppressed the migration of neutrophils to fMLP. We identified CPNE3 and Rab5a as direct targets of miR-451. Overexpression of miR-451 suppressed the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK via 14-3-3ζ, a known target of miR-451, and Rab5a. In SKG mice, miR-451 treatment reduced the severity of arthritis and the number of infiltrating cells. These results suggest that miR-451 suppresses neutrophil chemotaxis via p38 MAPK and is a potential target in the treatment of RA.

24574341	Title	Targeting miR-21 to treat psoriasis.
24574341	Abstract	Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease with limited treatment options that is characterized by a complex interplay between keratinocytes, immune cells, and inflammatory mediators. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulators of gene expression and play critical roles in many human diseases. A number of miRNAs have been described to be up-regulated in psoriasis, but their causal contribution to disease development has not been demonstrated. We confirm that miR-21 expression is increased in epidermal lesions of patients with psoriasis and that this leads to reduced epidermal TIMP-3 (tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 3) expression and activation of TACE (tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme)/ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17). Using patient-derived skin samples and mouse models of psoriasis, we demonstrate that increased miR-21 may be a consequence of impaired transcriptional activity of Jun/activating protein 1 (AP-1), leading to activation of the interleukin-6 (IL-6)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) pathway. Inhibition of miR-21 by locked nucleic acid (LNA)-modified anti-miR-21 compounds ameliorated disease pathology in patient-derived psoriatic skin xenotransplants in mice and in a psoriasis-like mouse model. Targeting miR-21 may represent a potential therapeutic option for the treatment of psoriasis.

24576478	Title	Involvement of cholesterol in hepatitis B virus X protein-induced abnormal lipid metabolism of hepatoma cells via up-regulating miR-205-targeted ACSL4.
24576478	Abstract	Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) plays crucial roles in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The abnormal lipid metabolism is involved in the hepatocarcinogenesis. We previously reported that HBx suppressed miR-205 in hepatoma cells. In this study, we supposed that HBx-decreased miR-205 might contribute to the abnormal lipid metabolism according to the bioinformatics analysis. Interestingly, we showed that the expression levels of acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4) were negatively associated with those of miR-205 in clinical HCC tissues. Then, we validated that miR-205 was able to inhibit the expression of ACSL4 at the levels of mRNA and protein through targeting its 3'UTR. Strikingly, we found that HBx was able to increase the levels of cellular cholesterol, a metabolite of ACSL4, in hepatoma cells, which could be blocked by miR-205 (or Triacsin C, an inhibitor of ACSL4). However, anti-miR-205 could increase the levels of cholesterol in the cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that the levels of cholesterol were increased in the liver of HBx transgenic mice in a time course manner. Functionally, oil red O staining revealed that HBx promoted lipogenesis in HepG2 cells, which could be abolished by miR-205 (or Triacsin C). However, anti-miR-205 was able to accelerate lipogenesis in the cells. Interestingly, the treatment with Triacsin C could remarkably block the role of anti-miR-205 in the event. Thus, we conclude that miR-205 is able to target ACSL4 mRNA. The HBx-depressed miR-205 is responsible for the abnormal lipid metabolism through accumulating cholesterol in hepatoma cells.

24576954	Title	MicroRNA-125b protects against myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion injury via targeting p53-mediated apoptotic signalling and TRAF6.
24576954	Abstract	The present study examined the role of microRNA-125b (miR-125b) in myocardial ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. We constructed lentivirus-expressing miR-125b (LmiR-125b) and developed transgenic mice with overexpression of miR-125b. LmiR-125b was transfected into mouse hearts through the right common carotid artery. Lentivirus vector (LmiR-Con) served as vector control. Untreated mice served as I/R control. Sham operation served as sham control. Seven days after transfection, the hearts were subjected to ischaemia (45 min) followed by reperfusion (4 h). Myocardial infarct size was analysed by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. In separate experiments, hearts were subjected to ischaemia (45 min) followed by reperfusion for up to 7 days. Cardiac function was measured by echocardiography before, as well as 3 and 7 days after myocardial I/R. Increased expression of miR-125b significantly decreased I/R-induced myocardial infarct size by 60% and prevented I/R-induced decreases in ejection fraction (EF%) and fractional shortening (%FS). Transgenic mice with overexpression of miR-125b also showed the protection against myocardial I/R injury. Increased expression of miR-125b attenuated I/R-induced myocardial apoptosis and caspase-3/7 and -8 activities. Western blot showed that increased expression of miR-125b suppresses p53 and Bak1 expression in the myocardium. In addition, transfection of LmiR-125b decreased the levels of TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and prevented I/R-induced NF-κB activation. miR-125 protects the myocardium from I/R injury by preventing p53-mediated apoptotic signalling and suppressing TRAF6-mediated NF-κB activation.

24577093	Title	MicroRNA-21 regulates T-cell apoptosis by directly targeting the tumor suppressor gene Tipe2.
24577093	Abstract	MicroRNAs (MiRs) are short noncoding RNAs that can regulate gene expression. It has been reported that miR-21 suppresses apoptosis in activated T cells, but the molecular mechanism remains undefined. Tumor suppressor Tipe2 (or tumor necrosis factor-α-induced protein 8 (TNFAIP8)-like 2 (TNFAIP8L2)) is a newly identified anti-inflammatory protein of the TNFAIP8 family that is essential for maintaining immune homeostasis. We report here that miR-21 is a direct target of nuclear factor-κB and could regulate Tipe2 expression in a Tipe2 coding region-dependent manner. In activated T cells and macrophages, Tipe2 expression was markedly downregulated, whereas miR-21 expression was upregulated. Importantly, Tipe2-deficient T cells were significantly less sensitive to apoptosis. Conversely, overexpression of Tipe2 in EL-4 T cells increased their susceptibility to activation-induced apoptosis. Therefore, Tipe2 provides a molecular bridge between miR-21 and cell apoptosis; miR-21 suppresses apoptosis in activated T cells at least in part through directly targeting tumor suppressor gene Tipe2.

24577233	Title	MicroRNA-21 controls the development of osteoarthritis by targeting GDF-5 in chondrocytes.
24577233	Abstract	Osteoarthritis is a common cause of functional deterioration in older adults and is an immense burden on the aging population. Altered chondrogenesis is the most important pathophysiological process involved in the development of osteoarthritis. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of chondrogenesis in patients with osteoarthritis requires further elucidation, particularly with respect to the role of microRNAs. MiR-21 expression in cartilage specimens was examined in 10 patients with knee osteoarthritis and 10 traumatic amputees. The effect of miR-21 on chondrogenesis was also investigated in a chondrocyte cell line. The effect of miR-21 on the expression of growth differentiation factor 5 (GDF-5) was further assessed by luciferase reporter assay and western blot. We found that endogenous miR-21 is upregulated in osteoarthritis patients, and overexpression of miR-21 could attenuate the process of chondrogenesis. Furthermore, we identified GDF-5 as the direct target of miR-21 during the regulation of chondrogenesis. Our data suggest that miR-21 has an important role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis and is a potential therapeutic target.

24578160	Title	MiR-29a/b/c regulate human circadian gene hPER1 expression by targeting its 3'UTR.
24578160	Abstract	Several essential biological progresses in mammals are regulated by circadian rhythms. Though the molecular mechanisms of oscillating these circadian rhythms have been uncovered, the specific functions of the circadian genes are not very clear. It has been reported that knocking down circadian genes by microRNA is a useful strategy to explore the function of the circadian rhythms. In this study, through a forward bioinformatics screening approach, we identified miR-29a/b/c as potent inhibitors for the human circadian gene hPER1. We further found that miR-29a/b/c could directly target hPER1 3'untranslated region (UTR) and down-regulate hPER1 at both mRNA and protein expression levels in human A549 cells. Thus, our findings suggested that the expression of hPER1 is regulated by miR-29a/b/c, which may also provide a new clue for the function of hPER1.

24578347	Title	GCNF-dependent activation of cyclin D1 expression via repression of Mir302a during ESC differentiation.
24578347	Abstract	Cyclin D1 plays an important role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and its expression is activated during gastrulation in the mouse; however, it remains unknown how cyclin D1 expression is regulated during early embryonic development. Here, we define the role of germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF) in the activation of cyclin D1 expression during embryonic stem cell (ESC) differentiation as a model of early development. During our study of GCNF knockout (GCNF(-) (/) (-) ) ESC, we discovered that loss of GCNF leads to the repression of cyclin D1 activation during ESC differentiation. This was determined to be an indirect effect of deregulation Mir302a, which is a cyclin D1 suppressor via binding to the 3'UTR of cyclin D1 mRNA. Moreover, we showed that Mir302 is a target gene of GCNF that inhibits Mir302 expression by binding to a DR0 element within its promoter. Inhibition of Mir302a using Mir302 inhibitor during differentiation of GCNF(-) (/) (-) ESCs restored cyclin D1 expression. Similarly over-expression of GCNF during differentiation of GCNF(-) (/) (-) ESCs rescued the inhibition of Mir302a expression and the activation of cyclin D1. These results reveal that GCNF plays a key role in regulating activation of cyclin D1 expression via inhibition of Mir302a.

24582497	Title	The breast cancer oncogene EMSY represses transcription of antimetastatic microRNA miR-31.
24582497	Abstract	Amplification of the EMSY gene in sporadic breast and ovarian cancers is a poor prognostic indicator. Although EMSY has been linked to transcriptional silencing, its mechanism of action is unknown. Here, we report that EMSY acts as an oncogene, causing the transformation of cells in vitro and potentiating tumor formation and metastatic features in vivo. We identify an inverse correlation between EMSY amplification and miR-31 expression, an antimetastatic microRNA, in the METABRIC cohort of human breast samples. Re-expression of miR-31 profoundly reduced cell migration, invasion, and colony-formation abilities of cells overexpressing EMSY or haboring EMSY amplification. We show that EMSY is recruited to the miR-31 promoter by the DNA binding factor ETS-1, and it represses miR-31 transcription by delivering the H3K4me3 demethylase JARID1b/PLU-1/KDM5B. Altogether, these results suggest a pathway underlying the role of EMSY in breast cancer and uncover potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets in sporadic breast cancer.

24582749	Title	miR-138-5p reverses gefitinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer cells via negatively regulating G protein-coupled receptor 124.
24582749	Abstract	Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs) such as gefitinib are clinically effective treatments for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR activating mutations. However, therapeutic effect is ultimately limited by the development of acquired TKI resistance. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a category of small non-coding RNAs commonly deregulated in human malignancies. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miRNAs in gefitinib resistance. We established a gefitinib-resistant cell model (PC9GR) by continually exposing PC9 NSCLC cells to gefitinib for 6 months. MiRNA microarray screening revealed miR-138-5p showed the greatest downregulation in PC9GR cells. Re-expression of miR-138-5p was sufficient to sensitize PC9GR cells and another gefitinib-resistant NSCLC cell line, H1975, to gefitinib. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay showed that G protein-coupled receptor124 (GPR124) was a direct target of miR-138-5p. Experimental validation demonstrated that expression of GPR124 was suppressed by miR-138-5p on protein and mRNA levels in NSCLC cells. Furthermore, we observed an inverse correlation between the expression of miR-138-5p and GPR124 in lung adenocarcinoma specimens. Knockdown of GPR124 mimicked the effects of miR-138-5p on the sensitivity to gefitinib. Collectively, our results suggest that downregulation of miR-138-5p contributes to gefitinib resistance and that restoration of miR-138-5p or inhibition GPR124 might serve as potential therapeutic approach for overcoming NSCLC gefitinib resistance.

24582811	Title	Upstream and downstream mechanisms for the promoting effects of IGF-1 on differentiation of spermatogonia to primary spermatocytes.
24582811	Abstract	The aim of this study is to delineate the mechanisms for the promoting the effects of insulin growth factor I (IGF1) on the differentiation of spermatogonia into primary spermatocytes. We used organ culture of testicular fragments from mice to observe the effects of varying agents and siRNAs. Real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting analysis were employed to quantify expression of genes. Luciferase reporter gene assay was employed for verifying the targeting relationship between miRNA and protein-coding genes. During spermatogenesis while spermatozoa pass through epididymis and vas deferens for maturation, expression of IGF1 and its receptor IGF1R, p44/ERK1 and p42/ERK2, and PI3K was all upregulated, whereas let-7 miRNA family members let-7a/b/d/e/g/ were downregulated. We established both IGF1 and IGF1R as cognate target genes for let-7; downregulation of let-7 resulted in upregulation of IGF1 and IGF1R during the early stage of differentiation from spermatogonia to primary spermatocytes. Transfection of let-7 inhibited, whereas transfection of anti-let-7 inhibitor enhanced the differentiation. The promoting effect of anti-let-7 was eliminated by PPP to block IGF1R phosphorylation. IGF1 activated ERK1/2 and PI3K and induced differentiation. PPP eliminated the activation of ERK1/2 and PI3K and inhibited the differentiation induced by IGF1. Specific inhibition of ERK1/2 by U0126 or PI3K by LY294002 reduced the IGF1-induced differentiation. Knockdown of ERK1/ERK2 or PI3K by siRNAs also blocked IGF1-induced spermatogenesis. Our study therefore identified downregulation of let-7 as an upstream mechanism for IGF1/IGF1R upregulation and activation of ERK1/2 and PI3K as a downstream mechanism mediating the IGF1 signaling cascade promoting differentiation of spermatogonia to primary spermatocytes.

24586203	Title	miR-100 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition but suppresses tumorigenesis, migration and invasion.
24586203	Abstract	Whether epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is always linked to increased tumorigenicity is controversial. Through microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling of mammary epithelial cells overexpressing Twist, Snail or ZEB1, we identified miR-100 as a novel EMT inducer. Surprisingly, miR-100 inhibits the tumorigenicity, motility and invasiveness of mammary tumor cells, and is commonly downregulated in human breast cancer due to hypermethylation of its host gene MIR100HG. The EMT-inducing and tumor-suppressing effects of miR-100 are mediated by distinct targets. While miR-100 downregulates E-cadherin by targeting SMARCA5, a regulator of CDH1 promoter methylation, this miRNA suppresses tumorigenesis, cell movement and invasion in vitro and in vivo through direct targeting of HOXA1, a gene that is both oncogenic and pro-invasive, leading to repression of multiple HOXA1 downstream targets involved in oncogenesis and invasiveness. These findings provide a proof-of-principle that EMT and tumorigenicity are not always associated and that certain EMT inducers can inhibit tumorigenesis, migration and invasion.

24586785	Title	Up-regulation of microRNA-190b plays a role for decreased IGF-1 that induces insulin resistance in human hepatocellular carcinoma.
24586785	Abstract	Insulin-like growth factor, (IGF)-1, is produced mainly by the liver and plays important roles in promoting growth and regulating metabolism. Previous study reported that development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was accompanied by a significant reduction in serum IGF-1 levels. Here, we hypothesized that dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNA) in HCC can modulate IGF-1 expression post-transcriptionally. The miRNAs expression profiles in a dataset of 29 HCC patients were examined using illumina BeadArray. Specific miRNA (miR)-190b, which was significantly up-regulated in HCC tumor tissues when compared with paired non-tumor tissues, was among those predicted to interact with 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of IGF-1. In order to explore the regulatory effects of miR-190b on IGF-1 expression, luciferase reporter assay, quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting and immunofluorecence analysis were performed in HCC cells. Overexpression of miR-190b in Huh7 cells attenuated the expression of IGF-1, whereas inhibition of miR-190b resulted in up-regulation of IGF-1. Restoration of IGF-1 expression reversed miR-190b-mediated impaired insulin signaling in Huh7 cells, supporting that IGF-1 was a direct and functional target of miR-190b. Additionally, low serum IGF-1 level was associated with insulin resistance and poor overall survival in HCC patients. Increased expression of miR-190 may cause decreased IGF-1 in HCC development. Insulin resistance appears to be a part of the physiopathologic significance of decreased IGF-1 levels in HCC progression. This study provides a novel miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanism for controlling IGF-1 expression in HCC and elucidates the biological relevance of this interaction in HCC.

24586944	Title	In vitro and in vivo activity of a novel locked nucleic acid (LNA)-inhibitor-miR-221 against multiple myeloma cells.
24586944	Abstract	The miR-221/222 cluster is upregulated in malignant plasma cells from multiple myeloma (MM) patients harboring the t(4;14) translocation. We previously reported that silencing of miR-221/222 by an antisense oligonucleotide induces anti-MM activity and upregulates canonical miR-221/222 targets. The in vivo anti-tumor activity occurred when miR-221/222 inhibitors were delivered directly into MM xenografts. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-MM activity of a novel phosphorothioate modified backbone 13-mer locked nucleic acid (LNA)-Inhibitor-miR-221 (LNA-i-miR-221) specifically designed for systemic delivery. In vitro anti-MM activity of LNA-i-miR-221 was evaluated by cell proliferation and BrdU uptake assays. In vivo studies were performed with non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD.SCID) mice bearing t(4;14) MM xenografts, which were intraperitoneally or intravenously treated with naked LNA-i-miR-221. RNA extracts from retrieved tumors were analyzed for miR-221 levels and modulation of canonical targets expression. H&E staining and immunohistochemistry were performed on retrieved tumors and mouse vital organs. In vitro, LNA-i-miR-221 exerted strong antagonistic activity against miR-221 and induced upregulation of the endogenous target p27Kip1. It had a marked anti-proliferative effect on t(4;14)-translocated MM cells but not on MM cells not carrying the translocation and not overexpressing miR-221. In vivo, systemic treatment with LNA-i-miR-221 triggered significant anti-tumor activity against t(4;14) MM xenografts; it also induced miR-221 downregulation, upregulated p27Kip1 and reduced Ki-67. No behavioral changes or organ-related toxicity were observed in mice as a consequence of treatments. LNA-i-miR-221 is a highly stable, effective agent against t(4;14) MM cells, and is suitable for systemic use. These data provide the rationale for the clinical development of LNA-i-miR-221 for the treatment of MM.

24587330	Title	Silencing of miR-34a attenuates cardiac dysfunction in a setting of moderate, but not severe, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
24587330	Abstract	Therapeutic inhibition of the miR-34 family (miR-34a,-b,-c), or miR-34a alone, have emerged as promising strategies for the treatment of cardiac pathology. However, before advancing these approaches further for potential entry into the clinic, a more comprehensive assessment of the therapeutic potential of inhibiting miR-34a is required for two key reasons. First, miR-34a has ∼40% fewer predicted targets than the miR-34 family. Hence, in cardiac stress settings in which inhibition of miR-34a provides adequate protection, this approach is likely to result in less potential off-target effects. Secondly, silencing of miR-34a alone may be insufficient in settings of established cardiac pathology. We recently demonstrated that inhibition of the miR-34 family, but not miR-34a alone, provided benefit in a chronic model of myocardial infarction. Inhibition of miR-34 also attenuated cardiac remodeling and improved heart function following pressure overload, however, silencing of miR-34a alone was not examined. The aim of this study was to assess whether inhibition of miR-34a could attenuate cardiac remodeling in a mouse model with pre-existing pathological hypertrophy. Mice were subjected to pressure overload via constriction of the transverse aorta for four weeks and echocardiography was performed to confirm left ventricular hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction. After four weeks of pressure overload (before treatment), two distinct groups of animals became apparent: (1) mice with moderate pathology (fractional shortening decreased ∼20%) and (2) mice with severe pathology (fractional shortening decreased ∼37%). Mice were administered locked nucleic acid (LNA)-antimiR-34a or LNA-control with an eight week follow-up. Inhibition of miR-34a in mice with moderate cardiac pathology attenuated atrial enlargement and maintained cardiac function, but had no significant effect on fetal gene expression or cardiac fibrosis. Inhibition of miR-34a in mice with severe pathology provided no therapeutic benefit. Thus, therapies that inhibit miR-34a alone may have limited potential in settings of established cardiac pathology. 

24590289	Title	Fibrotic extracellular matrix activates a profibrotic positive feedback loop.
24590289	Abstract	Pathological remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by fibroblasts leads to organ failure. Development of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by a progressive fibrotic scarring in the lung that ultimately leads to asphyxiation; however, the cascade of events that promote IPF are not well defined. Here, we examined how the interplay between the ECM and fibroblasts affects both the transcriptome and translatome by culturing primary fibroblasts generated from IPF patient lung tissue or nonfibrotic lung tissue on decellularized lung ECM from either IPF or control patients. Surprisingly, the origin of the ECM had a greater impact on gene expression than did cell origin, and differences in translational control were more prominent than alterations in transcriptional regulation. Strikingly, genes that were translationally activated by IPF-derived ECM were enriched for those encoding ECM proteins detected in IPF tissue. We determined that genes encoding IPF-associated ECM proteins are targets for miR-29, which was downregulated in fibroblasts grown on IPF-derived ECM, and baseline expression of ECM targets could be restored by overexpression of miR-29. Our data support a model in which fibroblasts are activated to pathologically remodel the ECM in IPF via a positive feedback loop between fibroblasts and aberrant ECM. Interrupting this loop may be a strategy for IPF treatment.

24592211	Title	A lentiviral sponge for miR-101 regulates RanBP9 expression and amyloid precursor protein metabolism in hippocampal neurons.
24592211	Abstract	Neurodegeneration associated with amyloid β (Aβ) peptide accumulation, synaptic loss, and memory impairment are pathophysiological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Numerous microRNAs regulate amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression and metabolism. We previously reported that miR-101 is a negative regulator of APP expression in cultured hippocampal neurons. In this study, a search for predicted APP metabolism-associated miR-101 targets led to the identification of a conserved miR-101 binding site within the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA encoding Ran-binding protein 9 (RanBP9). RanBP9 increases APP processing by β-amyloid converting enzyme 1 (BACE1), secretion of soluble APPβ (sAPPβ), and generation of Aβ. MiR-101 significantly reduced reporter gene expression when co-transfected with a RanBP9 3'-UTR reporter construct, while site-directed mutagenesis of the predicted miR-101 target site eliminated the reporter response. To investigate the effect of stable inhibition of miR-101 both in vitro and in vivo, a microRNA sponge was developed to bind miR-101 and derepress its targets. Four tandem bulged miR-101 responsive elements (REs), located downstream of the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) open reading frame and driven by the synapsin promoter, were placed in a lentiviral vector to create the pLSyn-miR-101 sponge. Delivery of the sponge to primary hippocampal neurons significantly increased both APP and RanBP9 expression, as well as sAPPβ levels in the conditioned medium. Importantly, silencing of endogenous RanBP9 reduced sAPPβ levels in miR-101 sponge-containing hippocampal cultures, indicating that miR-101 inhibition may increase amyloidogenic processing of APP by RanBP9. Lastly, the impact of miR-101 on its targets was demonstrated in vivo by intrahippocampal injection of the pLSyn-miR-101 sponge into C57BL6 mice. This study thus provides the basis for studying the consequences of long-term miR-101 inhibition on the pathology of AD.

24593661	Title	miR-30b regulates migration and invasion of human colorectal cancer via SIX1.
24593661	Abstract	CRC (colorectal cancer) is one of the most malignant tumours in both developing and developed countries. It is estimated that 60% of CRC patients have liver metastasis. In the present study, we show that miR-30b is an important regulator in human CRC migration and invasion, which are vital steps in CRC liver metastasis. miR-30b was significantly down-regulated in primary CRC specimens compared with normal tissues. Furthermore, miR-30b was much lower in liver metastasis tissues than in CRCs. We validated SIX1 (SIX homeobox 1), a member of the SIX homeodomain family of transcription factors and an EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition)-promoting gene, as the direct target of miR-30b. Forced expression of miR-30b inhibited CRC cell migration and invasion in vitro via its target gene SIX1. Furthermore, an inverse correlation between expression of SIX1 and miR-30b has been observed both in primary CRC specimens and liver metastasis. Taken together, miR-30b plays an important role in mediating metastatic related behaviour in CRC. miR-30b may serve as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for patients with CRC in the future.

24593893	Title	Advanced cancer therapy by integrative antitumor actions via systemic administration of miR-499.
24593893	Abstract	Previously, we developed tetraethylenepentamine-based polycation liposomes (TEPA-PCL) as a vector for the delivery of small RNAs. In the present research, we attempted tumor-targeted delivery of miR-499 via systemic administration and evaluated the potency of this system as a therapeutic strategy to treat cancer. Lipoplexes were formed by mixing cholesterol-grafted miR-499 (miR-499-C) with TEPA-PCL. Firstly, human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) and Colon 26 NL-17 mouse carcinoma cells were transfected with these lipoplexes in vitro. The results showed that miR-499 had antiangiogenic effects on the HUVECs and suppressed the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) from the Colon 26 NL-17 cells. In addition, the growth of the latter cells was inhibited by transfection with miR-499-C/TEPA-PCL. For in vivo delivery of miR-499 to tumors via systemic injection, miR-499-C/TEPA-PCL were decorated with Ala-Pro-Arg-Pro-Gly (APRPG) peptide-conjugated polyethylene glycol (PEG) to prepare APRPG-PEG-modified lipoplexes carrying miR-499 (APRPG-miR-499). APRPG-miR-499 were injected into tumor-bearing mice via a tail vein, and these lipoplexes accumulated sufficiently in both angiogenic vessels and cancer cells. In addition, the expression of miR-499-target proteins and VEGF in the tumor cells was clearly suppressed by the treatment with APRPG-miR-499. Finally, the therapeutic effect of miR-499 on tumor growth was evaluated in mice. The tumor growth was significantly inhibited by the intravenous injection of APRPG-miR-499 at such a low dose as 0.5mg/kg. These results suggest that miR-499 delivered by the present system has excellent potency to treat cancer via integrative anticancer actions.

24594117	Title	MicroRNA-21 is a unique signature associated with coronary plaque instability in humans by regulating matrix metalloproteinase-9 via reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motifs.
24594117	Abstract	Coronary atherosclerotic unstable plaque is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular death. Macrophage-derived matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 is considered for degrading extracellular matrix and collagen, thereby thinning the fibrous cap in plaques. miR-21 is implicated to play an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis. Nevertheless, miR-21 as the biomarker for coronary atherosclerotic unstable plaque remains unknown. We aimed to investigate the prediction role of miR-21 for unstable plaque by pathway study of miR-21 on MMPs and its inhibitor RECK in macrophages. Expression of miR-21 in macrophages and serum miR-21 as well as MMP-9 was measured in patients with coronary non-calcified plaque, calcified plaque and controls. In vitro experiment was done in human macrophages by over-expressing miR-21 or down-regulating RECK. The regulation of RECK and MMP-9 by miR-21 was evaluated by western blotting and siRNA strategy. Patients with non-calcified coronary artery lesions had significantly higher miR-21 in macrophages and lower miR-21 serum levels compared to the control and calcified plaque patients. At the same time, the serum levels of MMP-9 were significantly elevated in non-calcified patients. Experiments in vitro indicated that over-expressing miR-21 could induce the expression and secretion of pro-MMP-9 and active-MMP-9 in human macrophages via targeting gene RECK, and knocking down RECK expression by specific siRNA can resemble that of miR-21 over-expression. miR-21 might be a biomarker for plaque instability by suppressing target gene RECK to promote the expression and secretion of MMP-9 in macrophages.

24594381	Title	Versican 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) promotes dermal wound repair and fibroblast migration by regulating miRNA activity.
24594381	Abstract	Versican is an extracellular chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan which functions as a structural molecule but can also regulate a variety of cellular activities. This study was designed to explore the roles of versican in the process of dermal wound repair. To elevate levels of versican, we ectopically expressed the versican 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) as a competitive endogenous RNA to modulate expression of versican. We demonstrated that wounds closed faster in transgenic mice expressing the versican 3'UTR, as compared to those in wildtype mice. We stably expressed versican 3'UTR in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and found that the 3'UTR-transfected cells showed increased migratory capacity relative to vector-transfected cells. Interestingly, we found that the 3'UTRs of versican and β-catenin shared common microRNAs (miRNAs) including miR-185, miR-203*, miR-690, miR-680, and miR-434-3p. Luciferase assays showed that all of these miRNAs could target the 3'UTRs of both versican and β-catenin, when the luciferase constructs contained fragments harboring the miRNA binding sites. As a consequence, expression of both versican and β-catenin was up-regulated, which was confirmed in vitro and in vivo. Transfection with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting the versican 3'UTR abolished the 3'UTR's effects on cell migration and invasion. Taken together, these results demonstrate that versican plays important roles in wound repair and that versican messenger RNAs (mRNAs) could compete with endogenous RNAs for regulating miRNA functions.

24594795	Title	The antifibrotic effects and mechanisms of microRNA-26a action in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
24594795	Abstract	Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, and high-lethality fibrotic lung disease characterized by excessive fibroblast proliferation, extracellular matrix accumulation, and, ultimately, loss of lung function. Although dysregulation of some microRNAs (miRs) has been shown to play important roles in the pathophysiological processes of IPF, the role of miRs in fibrotic lung diseases is not well understood. In this study, we found downregulation of miR-26a in the lungs of mice with experimental pulmonary fibrosis and in IPF, which resulted in posttranscriptional derepression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and induced collagen production. More importantly, inhibition of miR-26a in the lungs caused pulmonary fibrosis in vivo, whereas overexpression of miR-26a repressed transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1-induced fibrogenesis in MRC-5 cells and attenuated experimental pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Our study showed that miR-26a was downregulated by TGF-β1-mediated phosphorylation of Smad3. Moreover, miR-26a inhibited the nuclear translocation of p-Smad3 through directly targeting Smad4, which determines the nuclear translocation of p-Smad2/Smad3. Taken together, our experiments demonstrated the antifibrotic effects of miR-26a in fibrotic lung diseases and suggested a new strategy for the prevention and treatment of IPF using miR-26a. The current study also uncovered a novel positive feedback loop between miR-26a and p-Smad3, which is involved in pulmonary fibrosis.

24594984	Title	MicroRNA-7a/b protects against cardiac myocyte injury in ischemia/reperfusion by targeting poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase.
24594984	Abstract	MicroRNA-7 (miR-7) is highly connected to cancerous cell proliferation and metastasis. It is also involved in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury and is upregulated in cardiomyocyte under simulated I/R (SI/R). We aimed to investigate the role of miR-7 during myocardial I/R injury in vitro and in vivo and a possible gene target. Real-time PCR revealed that miR-7a/b expression was upregulated in H9c2 cells after SI/R. Flow cytometry showed SI/R-induced cell apoptosis was decreased with miR-7a/b mimic transfection but increased with miR-7a/b inhibitor in H9c2 cells. In a rat cardiac I/R injury model, infarct size determination and TUNEL assay revealed that miR-7a/b mimic decreased but miR-7a/b inhibitor increased cardiac infarct size and cardiomyocyte apoptosis as compared with controls. We previously identified an important gene connected with cell apoptosis--poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)--as a candidate target for miR-7a/b and verified the target by luciferase reporter activity assay and western blot analysis. miR-7a/b is sensitive to I/R injury and protects myocardial cells against I/R-induced apoptosis by negatively regulating PARP expression in vivo and in vitro. miR-7a/b may provide a new therapeutic approach for treatment of myocardial I/R injury.

24594999	Title	TAp63 suppress metastasis via miR-133b in colon cancer cells.
24594999	Abstract	TAp63 is a tumour-suppressor protein that is often underexpressed in various types of cancer. It has been shown to activate gene transcription depending on the transcription domain and to be closely related with metastasis. In this study, we demonstrate that TAp63 suppresses metastasis in colon cancer cells through microRNA-133b. We evaluated the correlation of TAp63 and miR-133b with HT-29 and SW-620 cells and investigated the roles of TAp63 in the expression of RhoA, E-cadherin and vimentin. We further investigated the roles of TAp63-mediated invasion and migration of colon cancer cells. TAp63 expression is downregulated in colon cancer, and microRNA-133b is a transcriptional target of TAp63. Furthermore, microRNA-133b is essential for the inhibitory effects of TAp63 on RhoA, E-cadherin and vimentin. Moreover, TAp63 inhibits cell migration and invasion through microRNA-133b. Correspondingly, the inhibitory effect of TAp63 on RhoA, E-cadherin, vimentin, migration and invasion can be blocked by the microRNA-133b inhibitor. TAp63 and microRNA-133b were able to suppress the metastasis of colon cancer. Both TAp63 and microRNA-133b may be potential biomarkers for diagnosis in colon cancer metastasis and may provide unique therapeutic targets for this common malignancy.

24595016	Title	Estrogen regulates the tumour suppressor MiRNA-30c and its target gene, MTA-1, in endometrial cancer.
24595016	Abstract	MicroRNA-30c (miR-30c) has been reported to be a tumour suppressor in endometrial cancer (EC). We demonstrate that miR-30c is down-regulated in EC tissue and is highly expressed in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative HEC-1-B cells. MiR-30c directly inhibits MTA-1 expression and functions as a tumour suppressor via the miR-30c-MTA-1 signalling pathway. Furthermore, miR-30c is decreased upon E2 treatment in both ER-positive Ishikawa and ER-negative HEC-1-B cells. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-30c is an important deregulated miRNA in EC and might serve as a potential biomarker and novel therapeutic target for EC.

24598351	Title	Involvement of miRNAs in the early phase of halothane-induced liver injury.
24598351	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNA) form a class of small non-coding RNA molecules that negatively regulate gene expression. Most cellular pathways are modulated by miRNAs. However, the pathophysiological role of miRNAs during drug-induced liver injury (DILI) remains largely unknown. In this study, the possible involvement of miRNAs in DILI caused by the hepatotoxic drug halothane (HAL) was investigated. Toward this purpose, miRNA microarray studies of HAL-induced liver injury were performed in mice at five different time points up to 24h after dosing. To exclude any pharmacological effects on miRNA expression, isoflurane was used as a low hepatotoxic drug because it is structurally similar to HAL. Approximately 30-50% of the miRNA expression levels changed more than two-fold at every time point. In silico biological pathway analysis was performed to predict the targeted genes. Consequently, the miRNA gene down-regulation that occurred 1h after HAL administration was primarily related to inflammation, immune systems and liver injury. Based on additional in silico analyses, we identified miR-106b. Subsequently target of miR-106b was investigated using liver samples from mice with HAL-induced liver injury. Among the predicted targets, we discovered that a signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was particularly up-regulated beginning during the early phase of HAL-induced liver injury. Collectively, the suppressed miR-106b expression, as well as the subsequent up-regulation of STAT3, was critical for the pathogenesis of HAL-induced liver injury.

24599008	Title	MiR-525-3p enhances the migration and invasion of liver cancer cells by downregulating ZNF395.
24599008	Abstract	Liver cancer is one of leading causes of cancer-related deaths. A deeper mechanistic understanding of liver cancer could lead to the development of more effective therapeutic strategies. In our previous work, we screened 646 miRNAs and identified 11 that regulate liver cancer cell migration. The current study shows that miR-525-3p is frequently up-regulated in liver cancer tissues, and enhanced expression of miR-525-3p can promote liver cancer cell migration and invasion. Zinc finger protein 395 (ZNF395) is the direct functional target gene for miR-525-3p, and it is frequently down-regulated in liver cancer tissues. High expression of ZNF395 can significantly inhibit while knockdown of ZNF395 expression can markedly enhance the migration and invasion of liver cancer cells, suggesting that ZNF395 suppresses metastasis in liver cancer. Down-regulation of ZNF395 can mediate miR-525-3p induced liver cancer cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, miR-525-3p promotes liver cancer cell migration and invasion by directly targeting ZNF395, and the fact that miR-525-3p and ZNF395 both play important roles in liver cancer progression makes them potential therapeutic targets.

24599134	Title	miR-30-5p functions as a tumor suppressor and novel therapeutic tool by targeting the oncogenic Wnt/β-catenin/BCL9 pathway.
24599134	Abstract	Wnt/β-catenin signaling underlies the pathogenesis of a broad range of human cancers, including the deadly plasma cell cancer multiple myeloma. In this study, we report that downregulation of the tumor suppressor microRNA miR-30-5p is a frequent pathogenetic event in multiple myeloma. Evidence was developed that miR-30-5p downregulation occurs as a result of interaction between multiple myeloma cells and bone marrow stromal cells, which in turn enhances expression of BCL9, a transcriptional coactivator of the Wnt signaling pathway known to promote multiple myeloma cell proliferation, survival, migration, drug resistance, and formation of multiple myeloma cancer stem cells. The potential for clinical translation of strategies to re-express miR-30-5p as a therapeutic approach was further encouraged by the capacity of miR-30c and miR-30 mix to reduce tumor burden and metastatic potential in vivo in three murine xenograft models of human multiple myeloma without adversely affecting associated bone disease. Together, our findings offer a preclinical rationale to explore miR-30-5p delivery as an effective therapeutic strategy to eradicate multiple myeloma cells in vivo.

24599990	Title	Host microRNA regulation of human cytomegalovirus immediate early protein translation promotes viral latency.
24599990	Abstract	Reactivation of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a significant cause of disease and death in immunocompromised patients, underscoring the need to understand how latency is controlled. Here we demonstrate that HCMV has evolved to utilize cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) in cells that promote latency to regulate expression of a viral protein critical for viral reactivation. Our data reveal that hsa-miR-200 miRNA family members target the UL122 (immediate early protein 2) 3' untranslated region, resulting in repression of this viral protein. Utilizing recombinant viruses that mutate the miRNA-binding site compared to the sequence of the wild-type virus results in lytic rather than latent infections in ex vivo infections of primary CD34+ cells. Cells permissive for lytic replication demonstrate low levels of these miRNAs. We propose that cellular miRNA regulation of HCMV is critical for maintenance of viral latency. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a herpesvirus that infects a majority of the population. Once acquired, individuals harbor the virus for life, where the virus remains, for the most part, in a quiet or latent state. Under weakened immune conditions, the virus can reactivate, which can cause severe disease and often death. We have found that members of a family of small RNAs, termed microRNAs, encoded by human myeloid progenitor cells are capable of repressing a key viral protein, thus enabling the virus to ensure a quiet/latent state. As these progenitor cells mature further down the myeloid lineage toward cells that support active viral replication, the levels of these microRNAs decrease. Together, our data suggest that host cell microRNA regulation of HCMV is important for the quiet/latent state of this pathogen.

24599999	Title	Novel permissive cell lines for complete propagation of hepatitis C virus.
24599999	Abstract	Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major etiologic agent of chronic liver diseases. Although the HCV life cycle has been clarified by studying laboratory strains of HCV derived from the genotype 2a JFH-1 strain (cell culture-adapted HCV [HCVcc]), the mechanisms of particle formation have not been elucidated. Recently, we showed that exogenous expression of a liver-specific microRNA, miR-122, in nonhepatic cell lines facilitates efficient replication but not particle production of HCVcc, suggesting that liver-specific host factors are required for infectious particle formation. In this study, we screened human cancer cell lines for expression of the liver-specific α-fetoprotein by using a cDNA array database and identified liver-derived JHH-4 cells and stomach-derived FU97 cells, which express liver-specific host factors comparable to Huh7 cells. These cell lines permit not only replication of HCV RNA but also particle formation upon infection with HCVcc, suggesting that hepatic differentiation participates in the expression of liver-specific host factors required for HCV propagation. HCV inhibitors targeting host and viral factors exhibited different antiviral efficacies between Huh7 and FU97 cells. Furthermore, FU97 cells exhibited higher susceptibility for propagation of HCVcc derived from the JFH-2 strain than Huh7 cells. These results suggest that hepatic differentiation participates in the expression of liver-specific host factors required for complete propagation of HCV. Previous studies have shown that liver-specific host factors are required for efficient replication of HCV RNA and formation of infectious particles. In this study, we screened human cancer cell lines for expression of the liver-specific α-fetoprotein by using a cDNA array database and identified novel permissive cell lines for complete propagation of HCVcc without any artificial manipulation. In particular, gastric cancer-derived FU97 cells exhibited a much higher susceptibility to HCVcc/JFH-2 infection than observed in Huh7 cells, suggesting that FU97 cells would be useful for further investigation of the HCV life cycle, as well as the development of therapeutic agents for chronic hepatitis C.

24602316	Title	MiRNA-125a-5p: a regulator and predictor of gefitinib's effect on nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
24602316	Abstract	Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common malignancy in China and Southeast Asia. Radiotherapy is the major treatment modality for patients with NPC, but does not always achieve fully satisfactory outcomes. Studies have shown that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is highly expressed in NPC, and EGFR-targeted treatment is expected to be a new strategy for NPC. Recently, clinical trials have shown that NPC patients have different responses to gefitinib. Thus, the identification of indicators that can regulate and predict the sensitivity of NPC to gefitinib is very valuable. MiRNAs (MicroRNAs) are closely related to cancer development. We studied miRNAs in NPC cell lines to identify those that can regulate and predict the effectiveness of gefitinib on NPC. CCK8, Annexin V-FITC assays and animal models were carried out to evaluate the inhibitory effect of gefitinib on NPC cell lines HNE-1 and HK-1. MiRNA microarrays were used to detect and compare the miRNAs expression levels in the two cells with gefitinib or not, and qRT-PCR was used to evaluate miR-125a-5p expression in NPC cells and in serum of the tumor animal models. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments were taken to evaluate the effect of miR-125a-5p on gefitinib effectiveness. Western blots were used to evaluate the effect of miR-125a-5p on p53 and Her2 in HNE-1 and HK-1 cells. Gefitinib inhibited two NPC cell lines proliferation in vitro and in vivo,and HNE-1 cells were less sensitive than HK-1 cells to gefitinib.MiR-125a-5p expression levels were increased by geftinib in the two cell lines and in the serum of NPC tumor bearing-mice. This phenomenon was weak in HNE-1 cells and strong in HK-1 cells. MiR-125a-5p over expression improved anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of gefitinib on the NPC cells and that miR-125a-5p down-regulation decreased those effects. MiR-125a-5p also increased p53 protein expression in HNE-1 cells, and decreased Her2 protein expression in HNE-1 and HK-1 cells. Our results indicate that gefitinib sensitivity and some miRNAs expressions varied in NPC cell lines. The miR-125a-5p is a possible candidate that can regulate and predict the effect of gefitinib on NPC.

24603323	Title	miR-206 controls LXRα expression and promotes LXR-mediated cholesterol efflux in macrophages.
24603323	Abstract	Liver X receptors (LXRα and LXRβ) are key transcription factors in cholesterol metabolism that regulate cholesterol biosynthesis/efflux and bile acid metabolism/excretion in the liver and numerous organs. In macrophages, LXR signaling modulates cholesterol handling and the inflammatory response, pathways involved in atherosclerosis. Since regulatory pathways of LXR transcription control are well understood, in the present study we aimed at identifying post-transcriptional regulators of LXR activity. MicroRNAs (miRs) are such post-transcriptional regulators of genes that in the canonical pathway mediate mRNA inactivation. In silico analysis identified miR-206 as a putative regulator of LXRα but not LXRβ. Indeed, as recently shown, we found that miR-206 represses LXRα activity and expression of LXRα and its target genes in hepatic cells. Interestingly, miR-206 regulates LXRα differently in macrophages. Stably overexpressing miR-206 in THP-1 human macrophages revealed an up-regulation and miR-206 knockdown led to a down-regulation of LXRα and its target genes. In support of these results, bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) from miR-206 KO mice also exhibited lower expression of LXRα target genes. The physiological relevance of these findings was proven by gain- and loss-of-function of miR-206; overexpression of miR-206 enhanced cholesterol efflux in human macrophages and knocking out miR-206 decreased cholesterol efflux from MPMs. Moreover, we show that miR-206 expression in macrophages is repressed by LXRα activation, while oxidized LDL and inflammatory stimuli profoundly induced miR-206 expression. We therefore propose a feed-back loop between miR-206 and LXRα that might be part of an LXR auto-regulatory mechanism to fine tune LXR activity.

24603539	Title	miR-21 promotes human nucleus pulposus cell proliferation through PTEN/AKT signaling.
24603539	Abstract	The precise role of nucleus pulposus cell proliferation in the pathogenesis of intervertebral disc degeneration remains to be elucidated. Recent findings have revealed that microRNAs, a class of small noncoding RNAs, may regulate cell proliferation in many pathological conditions. Here, we showed that miR-21 was significantly upregulated in degenerative nucleus pulposus tissues when compared with nucleus pulposus tissues that were isolated from patients with idiopathic scoliosis and that miR-10b levels were associated with disc degeneration grade. Moreover, bioinformatics target prediction identified PTEN as a putative target of miR-21. miR-21 inhibited PTEN expression by directly targeting the 3'UTR, and this inhibition was abolished through miR-21 binding site mutations. miR-21 overexpression stimulated cell proliferation and AKT signaling pathway activation, which led to cyclin D1 translation. Additionally, the increase in proliferation and cyclin D1 expression induced by miR-21 overexpression was almost completely blocked by Ly294002, an AKT inhibitor. Taken together, aberrant miR-21 upregulation in intervertebral disc degeneration could target PTEN, which would contribute to abnormal nucleus pulposus cell proliferation through derepressing the Akt pathway. Our study also underscores the potential of miR-21 and the PTEN/Akt pathway as novel therapeutic targets in intervertebral disc degeneration.

24604078	Title	MicroRNA-155 negatively affects blood-brain barrier function during neuroinflammation.
24604078	Abstract	Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is a hallmark of neurological conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and stroke. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying neurovascular dysfunction during BBB breakdown remain elusive. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently emerged as key regulators of pathogenic responses, although their role in central nervous system (CNS) microvascular disorders is largely unknown. We have identified miR-155 as a critical miRNA in neuroinflammation at the BBB. miR-155 is expressed at the neurovascular unit of individuals with MS and of mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In mice, loss of miR-155 reduced CNS extravasation of systemic tracers, both in EAE and in an acute systemic inflammation model induced by lipopolysaccharide. In cultured human brain endothelium, miR-155 was strongly and rapidly upregulated by inflammatory cytokines. miR-155 up-regulation mimicked cytokine-induced alterations in junctional organization and permeability, whereas inhibition of endogenous miR-155 partially prevented a cytokine-induced increase in permeability. Furthermore, miR-155 modulated brain endothelial barrier function by targeting not only cell-cell complex molecules such as annexin-2 and claudin-1, but also focal adhesion components such as DOCK-1 and syntenin-1. We propose that brain endothelial miR-155 is a negative regulator of BBB function that may constitute a novel therapeutic target for CNS neuroinflammatory disorders.

24604117	Title	MiR-506 suppresses proliferation and induces senescence by directly targeting the CDK4/6-FOXM1 axis in ovarian cancer.
24604117	Abstract	Ovarian carcinoma is the most lethal gynaecological malignancy. Better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease and effective targeted therapies are needed to improve patient outcomes. MicroRNAs play important roles in cancer progression and have the potential for use as either therapeutic agents or targets. Studies in other cancers have suggested that miR-506 has anti-tumour activity, but its function has yet to be elucidated. We found that deregulation of miR-506 in ovarian carcinoma promotes an aggressive phenotype. Ectopic over-expression of miR-506 in ovarian cancer cells was sufficient to inhibit proliferation and to promote senescence. We also demonstrated that CDK4 and CDK6 are direct targets of miR-506, and that miR-506 can inhibit CDK4/6-FOXM1 signalling, which is activated in the majority of serous ovarian carcinomas. This newly recognized miR-506-CDK4/6-FOXM1 axis provides further insight into the pathogenesis of ovarian carcinoma and identifies a potential novel therapeutic agent.

24606447	Title	Cinobufacin suppresses cell proliferation via miR-494 in BGC- 823 gastric cancer cells.
24606447	Abstract	Cinobufacin is used clinically to treat patients with many solid malignant tumors. However, the mechanisms underlying action remain to be detailed. Our study focused on miRNAs involved in cinobufacin inhibition of GC cell proliferation. miRNA microarray analysis and real time PCR identified miR-494 as a significant cinobufacin- associated miRNA. In vivo, ectopic expression of miR-494 inhibited the proliferation and induced apoptosis of BGC-823 cells on CCK-8 and flow cytometry analysis. Further study verified BAG-1 (anti-apoptosis gene) to bea target of miR-494 by luciferase reporter assay and Western blotting. In summary, our study demonstrated that cinobufacin may inhibit the proliferation and promote the apoptosis of BGC-823 cells. Cinobufacin-associated miR-494 may indirectly be involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis by targeting BAG-1, pointing to use as a potential molecular target of cinobufacin in gastric cancer therapy.

Transforming growth factor-β receptor II (TGFβR2), as an important tumor suppressor, is involved in various cancer types. However, it is in cancer that only two miRNAs of this cluster and its paralogues have been reported so far to regulate TGFβR2. MiR-93 is oncogenic, but its targetome in cancer has not been fully defined. The role of miR-93 in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) still remains largely unknown. We firstly evaluated the clinical signature of TGFβR2 down-regulation in clinical samples, and next used a miRNA expression profiling analysis followed by multi-validations, including Luciferase reporter assay, to identify miRNAs targeting TGFβR2 in NPC. In vitro and in vivo studies were performed to further investigate the effects of miRNA-mediated TGFβR2 down-regulation on NPC aggressiveness. Finally, mechanism studies were conducted to explore the associated pathway and genes influenced by this miRNA-mediated TGFβR2 down-regulation. TGFβR2 was down-regulated in more than 50% of NPC patients. It is an unfavorable prognosis factor contributing to clinical NPC aggressiveness. A cluster set of 4 TGFβR2-associated miRNAs was identified; they are all from miR-17-92 cluster and its paralogues, of which miR-93 was one of the most significant miRNAs, directly targeting TGFβR2, promoting cell proliferation, invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, miR-93 resulted in the attenuation of Smad-dependent TGF-β signaling and the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway by suppressing TGFβR2, further promoting NPC cell uncontrolled growth, invasion, metastasis and EMT-like process. Impressively, the knockdown of TGFβR2 by siRNA displayed a consentaneous phenocopy with the effect of miR-93 in NPC cells, supporting TGFβR2 is a major target of miR-93. Our findings were also substantiated by investigation of the clinical signatures of miR-93 and TGFβR2 in NPC. The present study reports an involvement of miR-93-mediated TGFβR2 down-regulation in NPC aggressiveness, thus giving extended insights into molecular mechanisms underlying cancer aggressiveness. Approaches aimed at blocking miR-93 may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for treating NPC patients.

24606718	Title	Hyaluronan-CD44 interaction promotes c-Jun signaling and miRNA21 expression leading to Bcl-2 expression and chemoresistance in breast cancer cells.
24606718	Abstract	MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is associated with the development of solid tumors progression including breast cancer. In this study we investigated matrix hyaluronan (HA)-CD44 (a primary HA receptor) interaction with c-Jun N-Terminal Kinase (JNK)/c-Jun signaling in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells [a triple-negative (estrogen receptor-negative/progesterone receptor-negative/HER2-negative) breast cancer cell line]. Our results indicated that HA binding to CD44 promotes c-Jun nuclear translocation and transcriptional activation. Further analyses revealed that miR-21 is regulated by an upstream promoter containing AP1 binding site(s), and chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assays demonstrated that stimulation of miR-21 expression by HA/CD44 interaction is c-Jun-dependent in these breast cancer cells. This process results in an increase of the anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2 and upregulation of inhibitors of the apoptosis family of proteins (IAPs) as well as chemoresistance in MDA-MB-468 cells. Treatment with c-Jun specific small interfering RNAs effectively blocks HA-mediated c-Jun signaling and abrogates miR-21 production as well as causes downregulation of survival proteins (Bcl-2 and IAPs) and enhancement of chemosensitivity. In addition, our results demonstrated that anti-miR-21 inhibitor not only downregulates Bcl-2/IAP expression but also increases chemosensitivity in HA-treated breast cancer cells. Together, these findings suggest that the HA/CD44-induced c-Jun signaling plays a pivotal role in miR-21 production leading to survival protein (Bcl-2/IAP) upregulation and chemoresistance in triple negative breast cancer cells such as MDA-MB-468 cell line. This novel HA/CD44-mediated c-Jun signaling pathway and miR-21 production provide a new drug target for the future intervention strategies to treat breast cancer.

24606854	Title	MicroRNA-223 enhances radiation sensitivity of U87MG cells in vitro and in vivo by targeting ataxia telangiectasia mutated.
24606854	Abstract	Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein is important in the DNA damage response because it repairs radiation-induced damage in cancers. We examined the effect of microRNA-223 (miR-223), a regulator of ATM expression, on radiation sensitivity of cancer cells. Human embryonic kidney 293 T (293T) cells were infected with pLL3.7-miR-223 plasmid to generate the pLL3.7-miR-223 and -empty virus (EV) lentivirus (miR-223 and EV). A dual luciferase assay in which the reporter contained wild-type 3' untranslated region (UTR) of ATM was performed. U87MG cells were infected with miR-223 or EV to establish the overexpressed stable cell lines (U87-223 or U87-EV, respectively). Cells were irradiated in vitro, and dose enhancement ratios at 2 Gy (DER2) were calculated. Hind legs of BALB/c athymic mice were injected with U87-223 or U87-EV cells; after 2 weeks, half of the tumors were irradiated. Tumor volumes were tracked for a total of 5 weeks. The dual luciferase reporter assay showed a significant reduction in luciferase activity of 293T cells cotransfected with miR-223 and the ATM 3'UTR compared to that in EV control. Overexpression of miR-223 in U87MG cells showed that ATM expression was significantly downregulated in the U87-223 cells compared to that in U87-EV (ATM/β-actin mRNA 1.0 vs 1.5, P<.05). U87-223 cells were hypersensitive to radiation compared to U87-EV cells in vitro (DER2 = 1.32, P<.01). Mice injected with miR-223-expressing tumors had almost the same tumors after 3 weeks (1.5 cm(3) vs 1.7 cm(3)). However, irradiation significantly decreased tumor size in miR-223-expressing tumors compared to those in controls (0.033 cm(3) vs 0.829 cm(3)). miR-223 overexpression downregulates ATM expression and sensitizes U87 cells to radiation in vitro and in vivo. MicroRNA-223 may be a novel cancer-targeting therapy, although its cancer- and patient-specific roles are currently undefined.

24607788	Title	MiR-135a functions as a tumor suppressor in epithelial ovarian cancer and regulates HOXA10 expression.
24607788	Abstract	The activation of homeobox A10 (HOXA10) has been proved to be an important event in epithelial ovarian carcinogenesis, yet its regulation in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is still not fully understood. Here, we aimed to reveal the mechanism that a predicted target miRNA regulates HOXA10 expression and the association of its expression with progression of EOC. Here, by using computer-assisted algorithms from PicTar, TargetScan, and miRBase, we identified that the predicted target miRNA of HOXA10 was miR-135a. MiR-135a expression in EOC tissues and controls was measured with quantitative RT-PCR. The role of miR-135a and HOXA10 in the growth and survival of several EOC cell lines was determined with several in vitro approaches. We found that miR-135a expression was downregulated in an EOC patient cohort. Also, patients with low miR-135a expression had shorter overall survival and progression-free survival durations than those with high expression. Functional analysis of three EOC-derived cell lines (SKOV-3, HEY, and OVCAR-3) demonstrated that miR-135a directly regulated HOXA10 expression by targeting its 3'-UTR. Inhibition of HOXA10 expression with miR-135a mimics and HOXA10 siRNA consistently resulted in cell apoptosis with concomitant enhancement of caspase-3, increase of p53 expression and reduction of Bcl-2 expression, and also suppressed cell growth and adhesion. These findings suggest that ubiquitous loss of miR-135a expression is a critical mechanism for the overexpression of HOXA10 in EOC cells, which is implicated in epithelial ovarian carcinogenesis. Furthermore, miR-135a may be predictive of EOC prognosis.

24608041	Title	Negative regulation of Hif1a expression and TH17 differentiation by the hypoxia-regulated microRNA miR-210.
24608041	Abstract	The microRNA miR-210 is a signature of hypoxia. We found robust increase in the abundance of miR-210 (>100-fold) in activated T cells, especially in the TH17 lineage of helper T cells. Hypoxia acted in synergy with stimulation via the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) and coreceptor CD28 to accelerate and increase Mir210 expression. Mir210 was directly regulated by HIF-1α, a key transcriptional regulator of TH17 polarization. Unexpectedly, we identified Hif1a as a target of miR-210, which suggested negative feedback by miR-210 in inhibiting HIF-1α expression. Deletion of Mir210 promoted TH17 differentiation under conditions of limited oxygen. In experimental colitis, miR-210 reduced the abundance of Hif1a transcripts and the proportion of cells that produced inflammatory cytokines and controlled disease severity. Our study identifies miR-210 as an important regulator of T cell differentiation in hypoxia, which can limit immunopathology.

24608080	Title	MicroRNA-27a/b regulates cellular cholesterol efflux, influx and esterification/hydrolysis in THP-1 macrophages.
24608080	Abstract	Macrophage cholesterol homeostasis maintenance is the result of a balance between influx, endogenous synthesis, esterification/hydrolysis and efflux. Excessive accumulation of cholesterol leads to foam cell formation, which is the major pathology of atherosclerosis. Previous studies have shown that miR-27 (miR-27a and miR-27b) may play a key role in the progression of atherosclerosis. We set out to investigate the molecular mechanisms of miR-27a/b in intracellular cholesterol homeostasis. In the present study, our results have shown that the miR-27 family is highly conserved during evolution, present in mammals and directly targets the 3' UTR of ABCA1, LPL, and ACAT1. apoA1, ABCG1 and SR-B1 lacking miR-27 bind sites should not be influenced by miR-27 directly. miR-27a and miR-27b directly regulated the expression of endogenous ABCA1 in different cells. Treatment with miR-27a and miR-27b mimics reduced apoA1-mediated cholesterol efflux by 33.08% and 44.61% in THP-1 cells, respectively. miR-27a/b also regulated HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux in THP-1 macrophages and affected the expression of apoA1 in HepG2 cells. However, miR-27a/b had no effect on total cellular cholesterol accumulation, but regulated the levels of cellular free cholesterol and cholesterol ester. We further found that miR-27a/b regulated the expression of LPL and CD36, and then affected the ability of THP-1 macrophages to uptake Dil-oxLDL. Finally, we identified that miR-27a/b regulated cholesterol ester formation by targeting ACAT1 in THP-1 macrophages. These findings indicate that miR-27a/b affects the efflux, influx, esterification and hydrolysis of cellular cholesterol by regulating the expression of ABCA1, apoA1, LPL, CD36 and ACAT1.

24608434	Title	MicroRNA-149 targets GIT1 to suppress integrin signaling and breast cancer metastasis.
24608434	Abstract	Metastasis is the predominant cause of death in breast cancer patients. Several lines of evidence have shown that microRNAs (miRs) can have an important role in cancer metastasis. Using isogenic pairs of low and high metastatic lines derived from a human breast cancer line, we have identified miR-149 to be a suppressor of breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis. We also identified GIT1 (G-protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1) as a direct target of miR-149. Knockdown of GIT1 reduced migration/invasion and metastasis of highly invasive cells. Re-expression of GIT1 significantly rescued miR-149-mediated inhibition of cell migration/invasion and metastasis. Expression of miR-149 impaired fibronectin-induced focal adhesion formation and reduced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and paxillin, which could be restored by re-expression of GIT1. Inhibition of GIT1 led to enhanced protein degradation of paxillin and α5β1 integrin via proteasome and lysosome pathways, respectively. Moreover, we found that GIT1 depletion in metastatic breast cancer cells greatly reduced α5β1-integrin-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin and collagen. Low level of miR-149 and high level of GIT1 was significantly associated with advanced stages of breast cancer, as well as with lymph node metastasis. We conclude that miR-149 suppresses breast cancer cell migration/invasion and metastasis by targeting GIT1, suggesting potential applications of the miR-149-GIT1 pathway in clinical diagnosis and therapeutics.

24608802	Title	The up-regulation of miR-199b-5p in erythroid differentiation is associated with GATA-1 and NF-E2.
24608802	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent a class of small non-coding regulatory RNAs that play important roles in normal hematopoiesis, including erythropoiesis. Although studies have identified several miRNAs that regulate erythroid commitment and differentiation, we do not understand the mechanism by which the crucial erythroid transcription factors, GATA-1and NF-E2 directly regulate and control differentiation via miRNA pathways. In this study, we identified miR-199b-5p as a key regulator of human erythropoiesis, and its expression was up-regulated during the erythroid differentiation of K562 cells. Furthermore, the increase of miR-199b-5p in erythroid cells occurred in a GATA-1- and NF-E2-dependent manner during erythrocyte maturation. Both GATA-1 and NF-E2 bound upstream of the miR-199b gene locus and activated its transcription. Forced expression of miRNA-199b-5p in K562 cells affected erythroid cell proliferation and maturation. Moreover, we identified c-Kit as a direct target of miR-199b-5p in erythroid cells. Taken together, our results establish a functional link among the erythroid transcription factors GATA-1/NF-E2, miR-199b-5p and c-Kit, and provide new insights into the coupling of transcription and post-transcription regulation in erythroid differentiation.

24610393	Title	hsa-miR-4516 mediated downregulation of STAT3/CDK6/UBE2N plays a role in PUVA induced apoptosis in keratinocytes.
24610393	Abstract	Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder mediated by cross-talk occurring between epidermal keratinocytes, dermal vascular cells and immunocytes. Literature reveals that Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a protein involved in transmitting extracellular signals to the nucleus, is a possible important link between keratinocytes and immunocytes and is crucial to the development of psoriasis. Although photochemotherapy using UV in combination with 8 methoxypsoralen is one of the most effective therapy for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, its mechanism of action is largely unknown. Herein, we studied the change in miRNA profiles of cultured human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) before and after in vitro PUVA treatment by 8 methoxypsoralen and found significant up regulation of hsa-miR-4516. We for the first time demonstrate that ectopic expression of hsa-miR-4516 directly targets STAT3 protein by binding to its 3'UTR in HaCaT cells as confirmed by Luciferase reporter assays and Western blot analysis. We further show that overexpression of hsa-miR-4516 downregulates STAT3, p-STAT3, CDK6, and UBE2N proteins that are consistently upregulated in psoriasis and induces apoptosis in HaCaT cells. We also observed that anti-miR-4516 treatment was able to partially inhibit PUVA-induced apoptosis, suggesting that miR-4516 is involved in PUVA-induced apoptosis. Taken together, these results not only indicate the mechanistic involvement of hsa-miR-4516 in PUVA mediated effects by down-regulating STAT3 in HaCaT keratinocytes, but also highlight the potential of hsa-miR-4516 in development of novel therapeutic strategies.

24612089	Title	miR-494 acts as an anti-oncogene in gastric carcinoma by targeting c-myc.
24612089	Abstract	We recently showed that miR-494 was downregulated in gastric carcinoma (GC). The objectives of this study were to determine the role of miR-494 in GC malignancy and to identify its target genes. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was employed to quantify the expression level of miR-494 and c-myc in gastric cancer tissues. Bioinformatics was used to predict the downstream target genes of miR-494, which were confirmed by luciferase and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Cell functional analyses and a xenograft mouse model were used to evaluate the role of miR-494 in malignancy. miR-494 was downregulated in human GC tissues and in GC cells and was negatively correlated with c-myc expression. High level of c-myc or low level of miR-494 correlated with poor prognosis. The miR-494-binding site in the c-myc 3' untranslated region was predicted using TargetScan and was confirmed by the luciferase assay. Additionally, c-myc and miR-494 were enriched in coimmunoprecipitates with tagged Argonaute2 proteins in cells overexpressing miR-494. Furthermore, a miR-494 mimic significantly downregulated endogenous c-myc expression, which may contribute to the delayed G1/S transition, decreased synthesis phase bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, and impaired cell growth and colony formation; on the other hand, treatment with a miR-494 inhibitor displayed the opposite effects. Reduced tumor burden and decreased cell proliferation were observed following the delivery of miR-494 into xenograft mice. miR-494 is downregulated in human GC and acts as an anti-oncogene by targeting c-myc. miR-494 plays a role in the pathogenesis of gastric cancer in a recessive fashion.

24612558	Title	Downregulation of the miR-30 family microRNAs contributes to endoplasmic reticulum stress in cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle cells.
24612558	Abstract	Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a common subcellular response to stresses and central to ER stress is increased expression of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78). However, the mechanisms for GRP78 upregulation remained poorly understood. Our study goal was to shed light on this issue. H2O2 was used to create cellular models of ER stress in neonatal rat ventricular cells (NRVCs) and rat aorta vascular smooth muscle cells (RAVSMCs). Molecular Biology techniques were used to quantify protein and mRNA levels. Luciferase reporter gene assay was employed to investigate miRNA targeting. MTT assay and ELISA were used to detect cell death. MiRNAs belonging to the miR-30 family including miR-30a, b, c, d and e were all downregulated in ER stress induced by H2O2 in cardiovascular cells NRVCs and RAVSMCs, along with the upregulation of GRP78, cleaved ATF6, CHOP, and cleaved caspase-12. GRP78 was confirmed to be a target gene for miR-30. Artificial knockdown of miR-30 by antimiR-30 triggered the phenotypic ER stress with significant GRP78/ATF6/CHOP/caspase-12 upregulations and cell death, while miR-30 replacement mitigated ER stress. Knockdown of CHOP by siRNA regulated all members of the miR-30 family whereas sequestration of C/EBP transcription factor by its decoy downregulated miR-30 miRNAs. Collectively, downregulation of the miR-30 family miRNAs contributes to the ER stress and the associated upregulation of GRP78 in the cardiovascular system. The participation of miR-30 creates a positive feedback loop in the ER stress signaling pathway. MiR-30 replacement may be a viable approach for alleviating disorders associated with ER stress.

24613688	Title	Low expression of miR-150 in pediatric intestinal Burkitt lymphoma.
24613688	Abstract	Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive B-cell lymphoma with rapid proliferation. It has become evident that miRNAs are involved in hematopoietic malignancies. This study was undertaken to investigate the miRNA expression patterns of pediatric intestinal BL tissues. We collected 28 BL and 8 reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH) samples. miRNA expression profiling was performed in BL and RLH tissues to identify BL-related miRNAs, which were further analyzed by qRT-PCR and miRNA-ISH. In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot were used to define the protein targets of the BL-related miRNAs. Furthermore, we evaluated cell growth status by using methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay in Raji cell line, which was transected with the BL-related miRNA mimics or inhibitors. miRNA expression profiling showed that miR-150 had extremely decreased expression levels in BL patients. In both ISH and qRT-PCR analyses, BL had reduced levels of miR-150 expression compared with RLH. However, there is no significant correlation of miR-150 expression and EBV status in BL. Moreover, IHC and western blotting defined that c-Myb and Survivin are the protein targets of miR-150. Re-expression of miR-150 reduced the proliferation of Raji cells. Deregulation of miR-150 may be useful as a diagnostic tool in BL, based on miRNA profile screening, qRT-PCR and miRNA-ISH. miR-150 plays an important role in BL by targeting c-Myb and Survivin. Re-expression of miR-150 reduced the proliferation of Raji cells, which suggests it to be a promising novel candidate for tumor treatment.

24613834	Title	Anti-miR-197 inhibits migration in HCC cells by targeting KAI 1/CD82.
24613834	Abstract	To investigate the metastatic effects and mechanisms of miR-197 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The levels of miR-197 increased in HCC cells and tissues compared with a normal hepatic cell line (LO2) and adjacent nontumorous liver tissues, respectively. miR-197 expression negatively correlated with CD82 mRNA expression in these cell lines and tissues. Dual luciferase reporter assay and Western blot confirmed a direct interaction between miR-197 and CD82 3'UTR sequences. After miR-197 was silenced in HCC cells, CD82 expression increased. In the presence of human hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), cells silenced for anti-miR-197 exhibited elongated cellular tails and diminished lamellipodia due to reductions in both ROCK activity and the levels of Rac 1 protein. Downregulation of miR-197 along with the upregulation of CD82 in HCC cells resulted in the inhibition of HCC migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these data suggest that anti-miR-197 suppresses HCC migration and invasion by targeting CD82. The regulation of the miR-197/CD82 axis could be a novel therapeutic target in future HCC effective therapy.

24613919	Title	MicroRNA-23b is an independent prognostic marker and suppresses ovarian cancer progression by targeting runt-related transcription factor-2.
24613919	Abstract	Our previous study found that runt-related transcription factor-2 (RUNX2) was upregulated in human epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) tissues and may be involved in tumor progression and prognosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism by which RUNX2 is aberrantly expressed in EOC. We firstly confirmed that miRNA-23b directly targets RUNX2 in EOC. Then, ectopic expression of miR-23b significantly inhibited ovarian cancer cell proliferation and tumorigenicity by regulating the expression of RUNX2. Furthermore, the down-regulation of miR-23b was significantly correlated with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis of patients with EOC. Collectively, miR-23b may function as tumor suppressor through inhibiting the upregulation of RUNX2, and may be a potential prognostic marker for EOC.

24613926	Title	Down-regulation of miRNA-204 by LMP-1 enhances CDC42 activity and facilitates invasion of EBV-associated nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.
24613926	Abstract	Nasopharayngeal carcinoma (NPC) is an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated malignancy. It is known that microRNAs are implicated in the progression of NPC. However, the role of miR-204 in NPC is poorly understood. In this study, we found that miR-204 was down-regulated in NPC cells and tissues. Low-level expression of miR-204 was significantly associated with a more aggressive and poor prognostic phenotype of NPC. We further found that EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1 (LMP-1) suppressed miR-204 expression by activating Stat-3. Cdc42 was identified as a direct target of miR-204. Mir-204 inhibited EBV positive C666-1 cell invasion and metastasis partly through targeting cdc42.

24613927	Title	MiR-145, miR-133a and miR-133b inhibit proliferation, migration, invasion and cell cycle progression via targeting transcription factor Sp1 in gastric cancer.
24613927	Abstract	MicroRNAs have recently emerged as key regulators of gastric cancers. Here we found that miR-145, miR-133a and miR-133b were down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-145, miR-133a and miR-133b induced G1 cell cycle arrest and inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro. MiR-145, miR-133a and miR-133b targeted the transcription factor SP1, knockdown of which reduced the expression of MMP-9 and Cyclin D1 that were involved in cell growth and invasion. Thus, our findings demonstrated for the first time that miR-145, miR-133a and miR-133b suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion and cell cycle progression of gastric cancer cells through decreasing expression of Sp1 and its downstream proteins.

24614526	Title	Fumonisin B₁ modulates expression of human cytochrome P450 1b1 in human hepatoma (Hepg2) cells by repressing Mir-27b.
24614526	Abstract	Fumonisin B₁ (FB₁), a common mycotoxin contaminant of maize, is known to inhibit sphingolipid biosynthesis and has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma promoting activity in humans and animals. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression via translational repression. Human cytochrome P450 (CYP1B1) is highly expressed in oestrogen target tissues and catalyzes the metabolic activation of many procarcinogens. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of FB₁ on miR-27b suppression and its effect on CYP1B1 modulation in a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2). MiR27b and CYP1B1 expressions were evaluated in HepG2 cells by quantitative PCR. In order to directly assess the effect of miR-27b on CYP1B1 mRNA levels, cells were transfected with the mimic to miR-27b. CYP1B1 protein expression was measured using Western blot. FB₁ significantly down-regulated (11-fold) expression of miR-27b in HepG2 cells; whilst CYP1B1 mRNA and protein expression was significantly upregulated by 1.8-fold and 2.6-fold, respectively. CYP1B1 is post-transcriptionally regulated by miR-27b after HepG2 exposure to FB₁. FB₁-induced modulation of miR-27b in hepatic cells may be an additional mode of hepatic neoplastic transformation.

24615544	Title	MiR-200c suppresses TGF-β signaling and counteracts trastuzumab resistance and metastasis by targeting ZNF217 and ZEB1 in breast cancer.
24615544	Abstract	Resistance to trastuzumab and concomitantly distal metastasis are leading causes of mortality in HER2-positive breast cancers, the molecular basis of which remains largely unknown. Here, we generated trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells with increased tumorigenicity and invasiveness compared with parental cells, and observed robust epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and consistently elevated TGF-β signaling in these cells. MiR-200c, which was the most significantly downregulated miRNA in trastuzumab-resistant cells, restored trastuzumab sensitivity and suppressed invasion of breast cancer cells by concurrently targeting ZNF217, a transcriptional activator of TGF-β, and ZEB1, a known mediator of TGF-β signaling. Given the reported backward inhibition of miR-200c by ZEB1, ZNF217 also exerts a feedback suppression of miR-200c via TGF-β/ZEB1 signaling. Restoration of miR-200c, silencing of ZEB1 or ZNF217 or blockade of TGF-β signaling increased trastuzumab sensitivity and suppressed invasiveness of breast cancer cells. Therefore, our study unraveled nested regulatory circuits of miR-200c/ZEB1 and miR-200c/ZNF217/TGF-β/ZEB1 in synergistically promoting trastuzumab resistance and metastasis of breast cancer cells. These findings provide novel insights into the common role of EMT and related molecular machinery in mediating the malignant phenotypes of breast cancers.

24616020	Title	Identification of microRNA-214 as a negative regulator of colorectal cancer liver metastasis by way of regulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 expression.
24616020	Abstract	The purpose of this study was to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in the pathology of colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastasis and investigate their underlying mechanisms. A total of 39 miRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed between 16 primary CRC tissues with liver metastases and 16 CRC tissues without liver metastases from 32 patients by Affymetric miRNA microarrays. A panel of eight miRNAs were confirmed to be significantly and differentially expressed between CRC tissues with and without liver metastases through quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in the 32 patients. In a validated cohort of 99 CRC patients (44 with and 55 without liver metastases), only miR-214 was validated to be significantly down-regulated in CRC with liver metastases, which was associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Ectopic expression of miR-214 suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, tumor growth and liver metastasis in an in vivo xenograft mouse model, whereas miR-214 knockdown promoted proliferation, migration, and invasion in CRC cell lines. Further studies indicated that fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) was a potential target of miR-214. Restoring miR-214 expression in CRC cells decreased endogenous FGFR1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. FGFR1 knockdown mimicked the tumor suppressive effect of miR-214 on CRC cells, while reintroduction of FGFR1 abolished the tumor suppressive effect of miR-214 on CRC cells. Moreover, miR-214 expression levels were inversely correlated with FGFR1 in CRC patients. Down-regulation of miR-214 expression was correlated with increased FGFR1 expression levels, which may contribute to increased CRC liver metastasis. miR-214 may serve as a potential marker to predict survival, and the miR-214-FGFR1 axis may be a therapeutic target in CRC patients.

24616504	Title	Protective role of miR-155 in breast cancer through RAD51 targeting impairs homologous recombination after irradiation.
24616504	Abstract	Cell survival after DNA damage relies on DNA repair, the abrogation of which causes genomic instability and development of cancer. However, defective DNA repair in cancer cells can be exploited for cancer therapy using DNA-damaging agents. DNA double-strand breaks are the major lethal lesions induced by ionizing radiation (IR) and can be efficiently repaired by DNA homologous recombination, a system that requires numerous factors including the recombinase RAD51 (RAD51). Therapies combined with adjuvant radiotherapy have been demonstrated to improve the survival of triple-negative breast cancer patients; however, such therapy is challenged by the emergence of resistance in tumor cells. It is, therefore, essential to develop novel therapeutic strategies to overcome radioresistance and improve radiosensitivity. In this study we show that overexpression of microRNA 155 (miR-155) in human breast cancer cells reduces the levels of RAD51 and affects the cellular response to IR. miR-155 directly targets the 3'-untranslated region of RAD51. Overexpression of miR-155 decreased the efficiency of homologous recombination repair and enhanced sensitivity to IR in vitro and in vivo. High miR-155 levels were associated with lower RAD51 expression and with better overall survival of patients in a large series of triple-negative breast cancers. Taken together, our findings indicate that miR-155 regulates DNA repair activity and sensitivity to IR by repressing RAD51 in breast cancer. Testing for expression levels of miR-155 may be useful in the identification of breast cancer patients who will benefit from an IR-based therapeutic approach.

24616567	Title	MicroRNA-143 suppresses gastric cancer cell growth and induces apoptosis by targeting COX-2.
24616567	Abstract	To investigate the function of microRNA-143 (miR-143) in gastric cancer and explore the target genes of miR-143. A quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was performed to evaluate miR-143 expression in gastric cancer cell lines. After transfecting gastric cancer cells with miR-143-5p and miR-143-3p precursors, Alamar blue and apoptosis assays were used to measure the respective proliferation and apoptosis rates. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression was determined by real-time RT-PCR and Western blot assays after miR-143 transfection. Reporter plasmids were constructed, and a luciferase reporter assay was used to identify the miR-143 binding site on COX-2. Both miR-143-5p and miR-143-3p were significantly downregulated in multiple gastric cancer cell lines. Forced miR-143-5p and miR-143-3p expression in gastric cancer cells produced a profound cytotoxic effect. MiR-145-5p transfection into gastric cancer cells resulted in a greater growth inhibitory effect (61.23% +- 3.16% vs. 46.58% +- 4.28%, P < 0.05 in the MKN-1 cell line) and a higher apoptosis rate (28.74% +- 1.93% vs. 22.13% +- 3.31%, P < 0.05 in the MKN-1 cell line) than miR-143-3p transfection. Further analysis indicated that COX-2 expression was potently suppressed by miR-143-5p but not by miR-143-3p. The activity of a luciferase reporter construct that contained the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of COX-2 was downregulated by miR-143-5p (43.6% +- 4.86%, P < 0.01) but not by miR-143-3p. A mutation in the miR-145-5p binding site completely ablated the regulatory effect on luciferase activity, which suggests that there is a direct miR-145-5p binding site in the 3'-UTR of COX-2. Both miR-143-5p and miR-143-3p function as anti-oncomirs in gastric cancer. However, miR-143-5p alone directly targets COX-2, and it exhibits a stronger tumor suppressive effect than miR-143-3p.

24617339	Title	let-7 enhances osteogenesis and bone formation while repressing adipogenesis of human stromal/mesenchymal stem cells by regulating HMGA2.
24617339	Abstract	Bone and fat cells share a common progenitor, stromal/mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), that can differentiate into osteoblasts or adipocytes. Osteogenesis and adipogenesis of MSCs maintain homeostasis under physiological conditions. The disruption of this homeostasis leads to bone-related metabolic diseases. For instance, reduction in bone formation, which is usually accompanied by an increase in bone marrow adipogenesis, occurs with aging, immobility, or osteoporosis. Thus, it is crucial to gain an understanding of how osteogenic and adipogenic lineages of MSCs are regulated. Here, we present evidence that let-7 is a positive regulator of bone development. Using gain- and loss-of-function approaches, we demonstrate that let-7 markedly promotes osteogenesis and suppresses adipogenesis of MSCs in vitro. Moreover, let-7 could promote ectopic bone formation of MSCs in vivo. Subsequent studies further demonstrated that let-7's effects are mediated through the repression of high-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2) expression. RNAi depletion of HMGA2 could also enhance osteogenesis and repress adipogenesis. Overall, we found a novel role of let-7/HMGA2 axis in regulating the balance of osteogenesis and adipogenesis of MSCs. Thus, let-7 can be used as a novel therapeutic target for disorders that are associated with bone loss and adipocyte accumulation.

24619412	Title	Histone deacetylase-3 mediates positive feedback relationship between anaphylaxis and tumor metastasis.
24619412	Abstract	Allergic inflammation has been known to enhance the metastatic potential of tumor cells. The role of histone deacetylase-3 (HDAC3) in allergic skin inflammation was reported. We investigated HDAC3 involvement in the allergic inflammation-promotion of metastatic potential of tumor cells. Passive systemic anaphylaxis (PSA) induced HDAC3 expression and FcεRI signaling in BALB/c mice. PSA enhanced the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of mouse melanoma cells in HDAC3- and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1-(MCP1)-dependent manner. The PSA-mediated enhancement of metastatic potential involved the induction of HDAC3, MCP1, and CD11b (a macrophage marker) expression in the lung tumor tissues. We examined an interaction between anaphylaxis and tumor growth and metastasis at the molecular level. Conditioned medium from antigen-stimulated bone marrow-derived mouse mast cell cultures induced the expression of HDAC3, MCP1, and CCR2, a receptor for MCP1, in B16F1 mouse melanoma cells and enhanced migration and invasion potential of B16F1 cells. The conditioned medium from B16F10 cultures induced the activation of FcεRI signaling in lung mast cells in an HDAC3-dependent manner. FcεRI signaling was observed in lung tumors derived from B16F10 cells. Target scan analysis predicted HDAC3 to be as a target of miR-384, and miR-384 and HDAC3 were found to form a feedback regulatory loop. miR-384, which is decreased by PSA, negatively regulated HDAC3 expression, allergic inflammation, and the positive feedback regulatory loop between anaphylaxis and tumor metastasis. We show the miR-384/HDAC3 feedback loop to be a novel regulator of the positive feedback relationship between anaphylaxis and tumor metastasis.

24623314	Title	miR-638 suppresses cell proliferation in gastric cancer by targeting Sp2.
24623314	Abstract	MicroRNAs play important roles in the development and progression of various cancers. Recent studies have shown that miR-638 was downregulated in several tumors; however, its role in gastric cancer (GC) has not been investigated in detail. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of miR-638 and to elucidate its regulatory mechanism in GC. The expression levels of miR-638 and specificity protein 2 (Sp2) were detected by real-time PCR and Western blotting in GC. After pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR-638 vector, miR-638 inhibitor and Sp2-siRNA transfection, the AGS cell proliferation was investigated by MTT assay and cell cycle, and apoptosis was detected using the Annexin V/PI. In addition, the regulation of Sp2 by miR-638 was evaluated by real-time RT-PCR, Western blot and luciferase reporter assays; cyclin D1 expression was measured by Western blotting. The expression of miR-638 is dramatically down-regulated and Sp2 expression is remarkably up-regulated in GC tissues. Luciferase assays revealed that miR-638 inhibited Sp2 expression by targeting the 3'-UTR of Sp2 mRNA. Overexpression of miR-638 and Sp2-siRNA reduced Sp2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in vitro, and inhibition of miR-638 increased Sp2 expression. Moreover, we found that miR-638 overexpression and Sp2-siRNA markedly suppressed cell proliferation with decreasing expression of cyclin D1 and inducing G1-phase cell-cycle arrest in vitro; inhibition of miR-638 significantly promoted cell proliferation by increasing expression of cyclin D1 and leading more cells into the S and G2/M phase. Our results demonstrated that miR-638 suppressed GC cell proliferation by targeting Sp2 with influence on the expression of cyclin D1. We suggest that miR-638 might be a candidate predictor or an anticancer therapeutic target for GC patients.

24623846	Title	Docosahexaenoic acid modulates the enterocyte Caco-2 cell expression of microRNAs involved in lipid metabolism.
24623846	Abstract	Consumption of the long-chain ω-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and greater chemoprevention. However, the mechanisms underlying the biologic effects of DHA remain unknown. It is well known that microRNAs (miRNAs) are versatile regulators of gene expression. Therefore, we aimed to determine if the beneficial effects of DHA may be modulated in part through miRNAs. Loss of dicer 1 ribonuclease type III (DICER) in enterocyte Caco-2 cells supplemented with DHA suggested that several lipid metabolism genes are modulated by miRNAs. Analysis of miRNAs predicted to target these genes revealed several miRNA candidates that are differentially modulated by fatty acids. Among the miRNAs modulated by DHA were miR-192 and miR-30c. Overexpression of either miR-192 or miR-30c in enterocyte and hepatocyte cells suggested an effect on the expression of genes related to lipid metabolism, some of which were confirmed by endogenous inhibition of these miRNAs. Our results show in enterocytes that DHA exerts its biologic effect in part by regulating genes involved in lipid metabolism and cancer. Moreover, this response is mediated through miRNA activity. We validate novel targets of miR-30c and miR-192 related to lipid metabolism and cancer including nuclear receptor corepressor 2, isocitrate dehydrogenase 1, DICER, caveolin 1, ATP-binding cassette subfamily G (white) member 4, retinoic acid receptor β, and others. We also present evidence that in enterocytes DHA modulates the expression of regulatory factor X6 through these miRNAs. Alteration of miRNA levels by dietary components in support of their pharmacologic modulation might be valuable in adjunct therapy for dyslipidemia and other related diseases.

24623969	Title	Gene regulation by PAX6: structural-functional correlations of missense mutants and transcriptional control of Trpm3/miR-204.
24623969	Abstract	Pax6 is a key regulatory gene for eye, brain, and pancreas development. It acts as a transcriptional activator and repressor. Loss-of-function of Pax6 results in down- and upregulation of a comparable number of genes, although many are secondary targets. Recently, we found a prototype of a Pax6-binding site that acts as a transcriptional repressor. We also identified the Trpm3 gene as a Pax6-direct target containing the miR-204 gene located in intron 6. Thus, there are multiple Pax6-dependent mechanisms of transcriptional repression in the cell. More than 50 Pax6 missense mutations have been identified in humans and mice. Two of these mutations, N50K (Leca4) and R128C (Leca2), were analyzed in depth resulting in different numbers of regulated genes and different ratios of down- and upregulated targets. Thus, additional studies of these mutants are warranted to better understand the molecular mechanisms of the mutants' action. Mutations in PAX6 and PAX6(5a), including G18W, R26G, N50K, G64V, R128C, and R242T, were generated with site-directed mutagenesis. A panel of ten luciferase reporters driven by six copies of Pax6-binding sites representing a spectrum of sites that act as repressors, moderate activators, and strong activators were used. Two additional reporters, including the Pax6-regulated enhancer from mouse Trpm3 and six copies of its individual Pax6-binding site, were also tested in P19 cells. PAX6 (N50K) acted either as a loss-of-function or neutral mutation. In contrast, PAX6 (R128C) and (R242T) acted as loss-, neutral, and gain-of-function mutations. With three distinct reporters, the PAX6 (N50K) mutation broke the pattern of effects produced by substitutions in the surrounding helices of the N-terminal region of the paired domain. All six mutations tested acted as loss-of-function using the Trpm3 Pax6-binding site. These studies highlight the complexity of Pax6-dependent transcriptional activation and repression mechanisms, and identify the N50K and R128C substitutions as valuable tools for testing interactions between Pax6, Pax6 (N50K), and Pax6 (R128C) with other regulatory proteins, including chromatin remodelers.

24626817	Title	MicroRNA-100 regulates SW620 colorectal cancer cell proliferation and invasion by targeting RAP1B.
24626817	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been demonstrated to play important roles in tumorigenesis of human cancer. Fewer studies have explored the roles of miR-100 on human colorectal cancer cell proliferation and invasion. In this study, we utilized real-time PCR to verify whether miR-100 was downregulated in human colorectal cancer tissues compared with matched adjacent normal tissues. Functional studies demonstrated that ectopic expression of miR-100 inhabits cell growth and invasion and induce apoptosis, whereas knockdown of miR-100 yielded the reverse phenotype. Mechanistic studies reveal that miR-100 repressed the activity of a reporter gene fused to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of RAP1B, whereas miR-100 silencing upregulated the expression of the reporter gene. Furthermore, we also detected that RAP1B mRNA was inversely expressed with miR-100 in colorectal cancer tissues. These data indicate that the miR-100 plays a tumor suppressor role by regulating colorectal cancer cell growth and invasion phenotype, and could serve as a potential maker for colorectal cancer therapy.

24627221	Title	Single nucleotide polymorphism-specific regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 by multiple miRNAs targeting the coding exon.
24627221	Abstract	Microribonucleic acids (miRNAs) work with exquisite specificity and are able to distinguish a target from a non-target based on a single nucleotide mismatch in the core nucleotide domain. We questioned whether miRNA regulation of gene expression could occur in a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-specific manner, manifesting as a post-transcriptional control of expression of genetic polymorphisms. In our recent study of the functional consequences of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 SNPs, we discovered that expression of a coding exon SNP in the pro-domain of the protein resulted in a profound decrease in the secreted protein. This missense SNP results in the N38S amino acid change and a loss of an N-glycosylation site. A systematic study demonstrated that the loss of secreted protein was due not to the loss of an N-glycosylation site, but rather an SNP-specific targeting by miR-671-3p and miR-657. Bioinformatics analysis identified 41 SNP-specific miRNA targeting MMP-9 SNPs, mostly in the coding exon and an extension of the analysis to chromosome 20, where the MMP-9 gene is located, suggesting that SNP-specific miRNAs targeting the coding exon are prevalent. This selective post-transcriptional regulation of a target messenger RNA harboring genetic polymorphisms by miRNAs offers an SNP-dependent post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism, allowing for polymorphic-specific differential gene regulation. 

24628843	Title	Helicobacter pylori modulates cisplatin sensitivity in gastric cancer by down-regulating miR-141 expression.
24628843	Abstract	Recent studies found that gastric cancer patients with Helicobacter pylori infection had a better response to chemotherapy and had an improved overall prognosis compared with those without. However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was utilized to determine the expression profile of miR-141 in H. pylori infected cells and tissues and their respective controls. qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to determine the expression level of KEAP-1. Luciferase reporter assays were used to determine whether KEAP-1 was a direct target of miR-141 in the gastric cancer cells. MTT and apoptosis assay were performed to detect the survival of cells under cisplatin treatment. We found that H. pylori infection can significantly down-regulate miR-141 expression. Knockdown miR-141 expression in 7901/DDP and 7901 cells could significantly improve cisplatin sensitivity. Over-expression of miR-141 resulted in enhanced resistance to cisplatin in both gastric cancer cells. We also demonstrated that miR-141 directly targets KEAP1 by luciferase reporter assay, and that down-regulation of KEAP1 induces cisplatin resistance. Conversely, over-expression of KEAP1 significantly enhanced cisplatin sensitivity. Our 75 pairs of tissues also showed that KEAP1 was significantly up-regulated in H. pylori-positive tissues. Altogether, these findings demonstrated that the H. pylori infection could modulate cisplatin sensitivity through miR-141-mediated regulation of KEAP1.

24631504	Title	Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ-mediated induction of microRNA-145 opposes tumor phenotype in colorectal cancer.
24631504	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate diverse biological processes by inhibiting translation or inducing degradation of target mRNAs. miR-145 is a candidate tumor suppressor in colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Colorectal carcinogenesis involves deregulation of cellular processes controlled by a number of intertwined chief transcription factors, such as PPARγ and SOX9. Since PPAR family members are able to modulate complex miRNAs networks, we hypothesized a role of miRNA-145 in the interaction between PPARγ and SOX9 in colorectal carcinogenesis. To address this issue, we evaluated gene expression in tissue specimens of CRC patients and we took advantage of invitro models represented by CRC derived cell lines (CaCo2, SW480, HCT116, and HT-29), employing PPARγ activation and/or miRNA-145 ectopic overexpression to analyze how their interplay impact the expression of SOX9 and the development of a malignant phenotype. PPARγ regulates the expression of miR-145 by directly binding to a PPAR response element (PPRE) in its promoter at -1207/-1194bp from the transcription start site. The binding is essential for miR-145 upregulation by PPARγ upon rosiglitazone treatment. Ectopic expression of miR-145, in turn, regulates SOX9 expression through the binding to specific seed motifs. The PPARγ-miR-145-SOX9 axis overarches cell cycle progression, invasiveness and differentiation of CRC derived cell lines. Together, these results suggest that miR-145 is a novel target of PPARγ, acts as a tumor suppressor in CRC cell lines and is a key regulator of intestinal cell differentiation by directly targeting SOX9, a marker of undifferentiated progenitors in the colonic crypts.

24631505	Title	Reversible acetylation of Lin28 mediated by PCAF and SIRT1.
24631505	Abstract	Lin28 is a small RNA-binding protein that plays an important role in regulating developmental timing, stem cell reprogramming, and oncogenesis. However, the significance of the effect of post-translational modifications on Lin28 activity is not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrated that PCAF directly interacted with and acetylated Lin28. We also showed that the acetylation of Lin28 can be specifically reversed by the deacetylase SIRT1. These findings suggest that the PCAF/SIRT1 balance plays an important role in regulating Lin28 activity. Furthermore, we found that the cold shock domain of Lin28 is the major target of PCAF-mediated acetylation, which leads to a severe reduction in the Lin28 protein levels and an increase in the level of mature let-7a. This study provides the first demonstration that post-translational modification regulates Lin28 activity during let-7a biogenesis and sheds light on the regulation of Lin28 in ES cells and carcinogenesis.

24631531	Title	MicroRNA-363-mediated downregulation of S1PR1 suppresses the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
24631531	Abstract	S1PR1 plays a crucial role in promoting proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Over expression of S1PR1 is observed in HCC cell lines. The mechanisms underlying the aberrant expression of S1PR1 are not known well. MircroRNAs are important regulators of gene expression and disproportionate microRNAs can result in dysregulation of oncogenes in cancer cells. In this study, we found that miR-363, a potential tumor suppressor microRNA, downregulated the expression of S1PR1 and inhibited the proliferation of HCC cells. Bioinformatic analysis predicted a putative binding site of miR-363 within the 3'-UTR of S1PR1 mRNA. Luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-363 directly targeted the 3'-UTR of S1PR1 mRNA. Transfection of miR-363 mimics suppressed S1PR1 expression in HCC cells, followed by the repression of the activation of ERK and STAT3. Moreover, we found that the expression of downstream genes of ERK and STAT3, including PDGF-A, PDGF-B, MCL-1 and Bcl-xL, was suppressed after miR-363 transfection. Taken together, the present study demonstrated that miR-363 was a negative regulator of S1PR1 expression in HCC cells and inhibited cell proliferation, suggesting that the miR-363/S1PR1 pathway might be a novel target for the treatment of HCC.

24631532	Title	MiR-129-5p is down-regulated and involved in the growth, apoptosis and migration of medullary thyroid carcinoma cells through targeting RET.
24631532	Abstract	Dysregulation of the REarranged during Transfection proto-oncogene (RET) pathway and microRNA (miRNAs) are crucial for the development of medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC). Here we demonstrate that miR-129-5p is down-regulated in MTC tissues and cell lines and inhibits RET expression by directly binding its 3' untranslated regions. Ectopic expression of miR-129-5p significantly decreases cell growth, induces apoptosis and suppresses migration ability in MTC cells through decreasing the phosphorylated AKT, thus functioning as a tumor suppressor. These findings give new clues for understanding MTC carcinogenesis and may help in developing a therapeutic approach for the treatment of RET-activated MTC.

24634123	Title	MicroRNAs function primarily in the pathogenesis of human anencephaly via the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway.
24634123	Abstract	Anencephaly is one of the most serious forms of neural tube defects (NTDs), a group of congenital central nervous system (CNS) malformations. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in diverse biological processes via the post-transcriptional regulation of target mRNAs. Although miRNAs play important roles in the development of mammalian CNS, their function in human NTDs remains unknown. Using a miRNA microarray, we identified a unique expression profile in fetal anencephalic brain tissues, characterized by 70 upregulated miRNAs (ratio ≥ 2) and 7 downregulated miRNAs (ratio ≤ 0.5) compared with healthy human samples. Ten miRNAs with altered expression were selected from the microarray findings for validation with real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We found that in anencephalic tissues, miR-22, miR-23a, miR-34a, miR-103, miR-125a, miR-132, miR-134, miR-138, and miR-185 were significantly upregulated, while miR-149 was significantly downregulated. Furthermore, 459 potential target genes within the validated miRNAs were revealed using combined four target prediction algorithms in the human genome, and subsequently analyzed with the Molecule Annotation System 3.0. A total of 119 target genes were ultimately identified, including those involved in 22 singular annotations (i.e., transcription, signal transduction, and cell cycle) and 55 functional pathways [i.e., mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, and actin cytoskeleton regulation]. Six target genes (HNRPU, JAG1, FMR1, EGR3, RUNX1T1, and NDEL1) were chosen as candidate genes and associated with congenital birth abnormalities of the brain structure. Our results, therefore, suggest that miRNA maladjustment mainly contributes to the etiopathogenesis of anencephaly via the MAPK signaling pathway.

24635082	Title	MLK3 promotes melanoma proliferation and invasion and is a target of microRNA-125b.
24635082	Abstract	Metastatic melanoma is a disease with high mortality and limited therapeutic options. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can be used to classify melanoma stage. Expression of the miRNA miR-125b and serine/threonine kinase mixed lineage kinase (MLK)3 was assessed in primary malignant melanoma tissues and several melanoma cell lines by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The effect of MLK3 and miR-125b on cell proliferation was evaluated by MTS assay, and cell invasion was evaluated by Transwell invasion assays. Targeting of MLK3 by miR-125b was evaluated using luciferase reporter assay and western blotting. We found significantly increased levels of MLK3 in metastatic primary malignant melanomas and melanoma cell lines, with levels being especially high in metastatic lines. To investigate the functional significance of MLK3, we used knockdown MLK3, which was found to suppress cell growth and invasion. Using bioinformatics, we identified MLK3 as one potential target of miR-125b. miRNA transfection and luciferase assay confirmed that MLK3 was regulated by miR-125b at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Cell proliferation and cell invasion was inhibited by overexpression of miR-125b. MLK3 is upregulated in metastatic melanoma, and regulates cell proliferation and invasion in melanoma cells. MLK3 is a direct target of miR-125b. 

24636986	Title	The miR-424(322)/503 cluster orchestrates remodeling of the epithelium in the involuting mammary gland.
24636986	Abstract	The mammary gland is a very dynamic organ that undergoes continuous remodeling. The critical regulators of this process are not fully understood. Here we identify the microRNA cluster miR-424(322)/503 as an important regulator of epithelial involution after pregnancy. Through the generation of a knockout mouse model, we found that regression of the secretory acini of the mammary gland was compromised in the absence of miR-424(322)/503. Mechanistically, we show that miR-424(322)/503 orchestrates cell life and death decisions by targeting BCL-2 and IGF1R (insulin growth factor-1 receptor). Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expression of this microRNA cluster is regulated by TGF-β, a well-characterized regulator of mammary involution. Overall, our data suggest a model in which activation of the TGF-β pathway after weaning induces the transcription of miR-424(322)/503, which in turn down-regulates the expression of key genes. Here, we unveil a previously unknown, multilayered regulation of epithelial tissue remodeling coordinated by the microRNA cluster miR-424(322)/503.

24641951	Title	MiR-204/miR-211 downregulation contributes to candidemia-induced kidney injuries via derepression of Hmx1 expression.
24641951	Abstract	This study was aimed to exploit the role of heme oxygenase Hmx1 and the potential miRNA mechanisms in the kidney injuries induced by urinary tract infection by Candida species/Candidemia. We employed a mouse model of systemic Candidiasis by injection of the Candida albicans strain SC5314 into C57BL/6 mice. Kidney injuries were assessed by measuring serum cystatin C (CysC), serum β2-microglobulin (β2-MG) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Validation of miRNA target gene was conducted by luciferase reporter gene assay, Western blot analysis and real-time RT-PCR. We showed here that Candidemia caused significant downregulation of microRNAs miR-204 and miR-211. In sharp contrast, Hmx1 expression was remarkably upregulated, particularly at the protein level. Computational analysis predicted Hmx1 as a target gene for both miR-204 and miR-211 that share the same seed site sequence. We then experimentally validated the targeting relationship between miR-204/miR-211 and Hmx1, which explains the reciprocal changes of expression of miR-204/miR-211 and Hmx1 in Candidemia. Administration of miR-204/miR-211 mimics substantially downregulated Hmx1 and mitigated the severity of the kidney injuries induced by Candidemia, as reflected by improved renal glomerular filtration rate (GFR) determined by serum cystatin C (CysC), serum β2-microglobulin (β2-MG) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Knockdown of miR-204/miR-211 worsened while forced expression of miR-204/miR-211 ameliorated kidney injuries in mice with systemic Candidiasis. Our findings indicate that miR-204/miR-211 downregulation accounts at least partially for the Hmx1 upregulation and the miR-204/miR-211-Hmx1 signaling axis may contribute to immune-suppression in the host thereby the Candidemia-induced kidney dysfunction.

24642088	Title	7-Ketocholesterol inhibits isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 expression and impairs endothelial function via microRNA-144.
24642088	Abstract	Oxysterol is associated with the induction of endothelial oxidative stress and impaired endothelial function. Mitochondria play a central role in oxidative energy metabolism and the maintenance of proper redox status. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects and mechanisms of 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC) on isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) and its impact on endothelial function in both human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and C57BL/6J mice. HAECs treated with 7-KC showed significant reductions of IDH2 mRNA and protein levels and enzyme activity, leading to decreased NADPH concentration and an increased ratio of reduced-to-oxidized glutathione in the mitochondria. 7-KC induced the expression of a specific microRNA, miR-144, which in turn targets and downregulates IDH2. In silico analysis predicted that miR-144 could bind to the 3'-untranslated region of IDH2 mRNA. Overexpression of miR-144 decreased the expression of IDH2 and the levels of NADPH. A complementary finding is that a miR-144 inhibitor increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of IDH2. Furthermore, miR-144 level was elevated in HAECs in response to 7-KC. Anti-Ago1/2 immunoprecipitation coupled with a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that 7-KC increased the functional targeting of miR-144/IDH2 mRNA in HAECs. Infusion of 7-KC in vivo decreased vascular IDH2 expression and impaired vascular reactivity via miR-144. 7-KC controls miR-144 expression, which in turn decreases IDH2 expression and attenuates NO bioavailability to impair endothelial homeostasis. The newly identified 7-KC-miR-144-IDH2 pathway may contribute to atherosclerosis progression and provides new insight into 7-KC function and microRNA biology in cardiovascular disease.

24647639	Title	miR-139-5p modulates cortical neuronal migration by targeting Lis1 in a rat model of focal cortical dysplasia.
24647639	Abstract	Accumulating evidence has indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) play important roles in the developing rat brain. In this study, we investigated the role of miRNAs in the brains of immature (20-80 days) rats with liquid nitrogen lesion-induced focal cortical dysplasia. miRNA microarray demonstrated that the expression of miR-139‑5p was associated with cortical development. Bioinformatic analysis and luciferase assays revealed that the Lis1 gene is a likely target of miR-139‑5p. It is known that Lis1 plays a role in cell proliferation and migration and can lead to cortical dysplasia when mutated. Our data demonstrated an inhibitory effect of miR-139-5p on the expression of Lis1 in PC12 cells 24 h following transfection with pre-miR-139-5p. However, when the PC12 cells were transfected with anti-miR-139-5p, an increase was observed in the expression of Lis1. Cell migration assay revealed that miR-139-5p significantly inhibited the migration of PC12 and HCN-2 cells treated with or without Lis1 protein. In addition, a rat model of focal cortical dysplasia was established, wherein miR-139-5p was administered and Lis1 expression was found to be markedly reduced. Moreover, the injured cortex showed a certain degree of recovery following the administration of miR‑139-5p, demonstrating that the reduction in miR-139-5p was at least partially responsible for the upregulation of Lis1 in the rat brains. Our data suggest that miR-139-5p modulates cortical neuronal migration by targeting Lis1.

24647918	Title	Synergistic antitumor activity of resveratrol and miR-200c in human lung cancer.
24647918	Abstract	MicroRNAs have emerged as promising molecular factors with potential for clinical applications in cancer diagnosis and therapy. In the present study, we demonstrated that the level of miR-200c in lung cancer tissues was lower than that in normal tissues using real-time PCR. To further investigate the effects of miR-200c expression in lung cancer cells, we upregulated miR-200c levels in H460 cells using transfection. We found that the percentage of apoptotic cells was higher in the cells expressing miR-200c than that in the untransfected cells. Furthermore, the antitumor activities of miR-200c were demonstrated in vivo. Notably, we confirmed that reservatol (RESV) showed stronger antitumor activities in miR-200c-positive cells than in miR-200c-negative cells. Finally, we demonstrated that expression of miR-200c in H460 cells suppressed cell growth by targeting RECK, followed by activation of the JNK signaling pathway and ER stress. Collectively, these data show that miR-200c expression sensitizes H460 cells to RESV and this is likely due to RECK expression.

24647998	Title	miR-1303 targets claudin-18 gene to modulate proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells.
24647998	Abstract	MicroRNAs have emerged as important gene regulators and are recognized as important molecules in carcinogenesis. However, the effects of microRNA-1303 (miR-1303) on gastric cancer (GC) cells and the upstream regulation of GC-associated claudin-18 gene (CLDN18) remain unclear. miR-1303 may be involved in the tumorigenesis of GC by targeting CLDN18. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of miR-1303 targeting of CLDN18 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of human GC cells. The expression of miR-1303 and claudin-18 in GC tissues and gastric cancer cell lines were detected by qRT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. CCK8 and colony formation assays were performed to study the influence of miR-1303 on the proliferation of the GC cell lines. Transwell and wound-healing assays were carried out to investigate the effect of miR-1303 on the invasion and migration of GC cell lines. Luciferase reporter assays, restore assays and western blotting were used to demonstrate whether CLDN18 is a direct target of miR-1303. miR-1303 was significantly overexpressed whereas claudin-18 was downregulated in GC tissues and cell lines, which was significantly associated with tumor size, location invasion, histologic type and tumor-node-metastasis stage. Cell proliferation rates were reduced, and cell invasion and migratory ability was significantly restricted in miR-1303 inhibitor-transfected groups. miR-1303 could bind to the putative binding sites in CLDN18 mRNA 3'-UTR and visibly lower the expression of claudin-18. The introduction of claudin-18 without 3'-UTR restored the miR-1303 promoting migration function. Downregulation of miR-1303 can inhibit proliferation, migration and invasion of GC cells by targeting CLDN18.

24648008	Title	Identification of blood serum micro-RNAs associated with idiopathic and LRRK2 Parkinson's disease.
24648008	Abstract	Blood-cell-free circulating micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as potential accessible biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). Here we analyzed the serum levels of 377 miRNAs in a discovery set of 10 idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) patients, 10 PD patients carriers of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation (LRRK2 PD), and 10 controls by using real-time quantitative PCR-based TaqMan MicroRNA arrays. We detected candidate differentially expressed miRNAs, which were further tested in a first validation set consisting of 20 IPD, 20 LRRK2 PD, and 20 control samples. We found four statistically significant miRNAs that were downregulated in either LRRK2 or IPD (miR-29a, miR-29c, miR-19a, and miR-19b). Subsequently, we validated these findings in a third set of samples consisting of 65 IPD and 65 controls and confirmed the association of downregulated levels of miR-29c, miR-29a, and miR-19b in IPD. Differentially expressed miRNAs are predicted to target genes belonging to pathways related to ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, MAPK, Wnt, mTOR, adipocytokine, and neuron projection. Results from our exploratory study indicate that downregulated levels of specific circulating serum miRNAs are associated with PD and suggest their potential use as noninvasive biomarkers for PD. Future studies should further confirm the association of these miRNAs with PD. 

24648262	Title	MicroRNA-338-3p regulates osteogenic differentiation of mouse bone marrow stromal stem cells by targeting Runx2 and Fgfr2.
24648262	Abstract	The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that govern the differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) could provide new insight into the treatment of bone loss diseases. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression during stem cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. In the present study, we showed that miR-338-3p expression was significantly down-regulated during the osteoblastic differentiation of BMSCs. Additionally, miR-338-3p was up-regulated in ovariectomized (OVX) mice compared with sham mice. An in vitro analysis revealed that the over-expression of miR-338-3p can inhibit the expression of osteoblast differentiation markers such as Osterix (Osx), thus reducing osteoblast differentiation. Bioinformatic analysis and dual luciferase assays confirmed that miR-338-3p can repress gene expression by targeting Runx2 and Fgfr2. In the BMSCs derived from OVX mice, the inhibition of miR-338-3p partially rescued mineralization and osteoblast differentiation. Taken together, our data show that miR-338-3p plays an important role during osteoblast differentiation of BMSCs and serves as a potential modulator of osteoporosis via its effect on osteoblasts.

24648290	Title	Pleiotropic antitumor effects of the pan-HDAC inhibitor ITF2357 against c-Myc-overexpressing human B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
24648290	Abstract	Histone deacetylases (HDAC) extensively contribute to the c-Myc oncogenic program, pointing to their inhibition as an effective strategy against c-Myc-overexpressing cancers. We, thus, studied the therapeutic activity of the new-generation pan-HDAC inhibitor ITF2357 (Givinostat®) against c-Myc-overexpressing human B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHLs). ITF2357 anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects were analyzed in B-NHL cell lines with c-Myc translocations (Namalwa, Raji and DOHH-2), stabilizing mutations (Raji) or post-transcriptional alterations (SU-DHL-4) in relationship to c-Myc modulation. ITF2357 significantly delayed the in vitro growth of all B-NHL cell lines by inducing G1 cell-cycle arrest, eventually followed by cell death. These events correlated with the extent of c-Myc protein, but not mRNA, downregulation, indicating the involvement of post-transcriptional mechanisms. Accordingly, c-Myc-targeting microRNAs let-7a and miR-26a were induced in all treated lymphomas and the cap-dependent translation machinery components 4E-BP1, eIF4E and eIF4G, as well as their upstream regulators, Akt and PIM kinases, were inhibited in function of the cell sensitivity to ITF2357, and, in turn, c-Myc downregulation. In vivo, ITF2357 significantly hampered the growth of Namalwa and Raji xenografts in immunodeficient mice. Noteworthy, its combination with suboptimal cyclophosphamide, achieved complete remissions in most animals and equaled or even exceeded the activity of optimal cyclophosphamide. Collectively, our findings provide the rationale for testing the clinical advantages of adding ITF2357 to current therapies for the still very ominous c-Myc-overexpressing lymphomas. They equally provide the proof-of-concept for its clinical evaluation in rational combination with the promising inhibitors of B-cell receptor and PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis currently in the process of development.

24650454	Title	MicroRNA-21 regulates biological behaviors in papillary thyroid carcinoma by targeting programmed cell death 4.
24650454	Abstract	Our recent study has found that microRNA-21 (miRNA-21) was significantly upregulated in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) tissues compared with nontumor tissues by using miRNA microarray chip. However, the function of miRNA-21 is unknown in PTC. The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of miRNA-21 in PTC and the mechanism of gene regulation by it. We transfected PTC cell line (TPC-1) with pEZX-eGFP-miRNA-21 plasmid to determine the biological functions of miRNA-21. Western blot assay was applied to investigate the correlation between miRNA-21 and programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) expression in TPC-1 cell line. Overexpression of miRNA-21 could significantly enhance proliferation and invasion and inhibit the apoptosis of TPC-1 cells. In addition, miRNA-21 and PDCD4 expression showed a significantly negative correlation in TPC-1 cells. These data suggest that miRNA-21 may play an oncogenic role by directly targeting PDCD4 in the cellular processes of PTC. In addition, the findings in our present study also may represent new clues for the diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in the treatment of PTC.

24650661	Title	MiR-29b inhibits collagen maturation in hepatic stellate cells through down-regulating the expression of HSP47 and lysyl oxidase.
24650661	Abstract	Altered expression of miR-29b is implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of liver fibrosis. We and others previously demonstrated that miR-29b down-regulates the expression of several extracellular-matrix (ECM) genes including Col 1A1, Col 3A1 and Elastin via directly targeting their 3'-UTRs. However, whether or not miR-29b plays a role in the post-translational regulation of ECM biosynthesis has not been reported. Heat shock protein 47 (HSP47) and lysyl oxidase (LOX) are known to be essential for ECM maturation. In this study we have demonstrated that expression of HSP47 and LOX was significantly up-regulated in culture-activated primary rat hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), TGF-β stimulated LX-2 cells and liver tissue of CCl4-treated mice, which was accompanied by a decrease of miR-29b level. In addition, over-expression of miR-29b in LX-2 cells resulted in significant inhibition on HSP47 and LOX expression. Mechanistically, miR-29b inhibited the expression of a reporter gene that contains the respective full-length 3'-UTR from HSP47 and LOX gene, and this inhibitory effect was abolished by the deletion of a putative miR-29b targeting sequence from the 3'-UTRs. Transfection of LX-2 cells with miR-29b led to abnormal collagen structure as shown by electron-microscopy, presumably through down-regulation of the expression of molecules involved in ECM maturation including HSP47 and LOX. These results demonstrated that miR-29b is involved in regulating the post-translational processing of ECM and fibril formation.

24655788	Title	Up-regulated miR-199a-5p in gastric cancer functions as an oncogene and targets klotho.
24655788	Abstract	Recent studies have shown that miR-199a-5p plays opposite roles in cancer initiation and progression of different cancer types, acting as oncogene for some cancer types but as tumor suppressor gene for others. However, the role and molecular mechanism of miR-199a-5p in gastric cancer are largely unknown. In this study, miR-199a-5p expression level in gastric cancer was first analyzed by qPCRand then validated in 103 gastric cancer patients by in situ hybridization (ISH). Gastric cancer cell lines were transfected with miR-199a-5p inhibitor and mimic, and underwent in vitro transwell assays. Target genes (klotho) were identified using Luciferase reporter assay. Immunohistochemical staining was also used to investigate on how miR-199a-5p regulates the tumour-suppressive effects of klotho in gastric cancer. In our present study, we found that miR-199a-5p level was significantly increased in gastric cancer tissues compared to paired normal tissues. We observed that miR-199a-5p could promote migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells. In situ hybridization of miR-199a-5p also confirmed that higher miR-199a-5p expression level was associated with increased likelihood of lymph node metastasis and later TNM stage. Luciferase reporter assay and immunohistochemistry revealed that klotho might be the downstream target of miR-199a-5p. Our present study suggests that miR-199a-5p acts as an oncogene in gastric cancer and functions by targeting klotho.

24657437	Title	MicroRNA-432 contributes to dopamine cocktail and retinoic acid induced differentiation of human neuroblastoma cells by targeting NESTIN and RCOR1 genes.
24657437	Abstract	MicroRNA (miRNA) regulates expression of protein coding genes and has been implicated in diverse cellular processes including neuronal differentiation, cell growth and death. To identify the role of miRNA in neuronal differentiation, SH-SY5Y and IMR-32 cells were treated with dopamine cocktail and retinoic acid to induce differentiation. Detection of miRNAs in differentiated cells revealed that expression of many miRNAs was altered significantly. Among the altered miRNAs, human brain expressed miR-432 induced neurite projections, arrested cells in G0-G1, reduced cell proliferation and could significantly repress NESTIN/NES, RCOR1/COREST and MECP2. Our results reveal that miR-432 regulate neuronal differentiation of human neuroblastoma cells.

24657879	Title	Loss of MicroRNA-155 protects the heart from pathological cardiac hypertrophy.
24657879	Abstract	In response to mechanical and pathological stress, adult mammalian hearts often undergo mal-remodeling, a process commonly characterized as pathological hypertrophy, which is associated with upregulation of fetal genes, increased fibrosis, and reduction of cardiac dysfunction. The molecular pathways that regulate this process are not fully understood. To explore the function of microRNA-155 (miR-155) in cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling. Our previous work identified miR-155 as a critical microRNA that repressed the expression and function of the myocyte enhancer factor 2A. In this study, we found that miR-155 is expressed in cardiomyocytes and that its expression is reduced in pressure overload-induced hypertrophic hearts. In mouse models of cardiac hypertrophy, miR-155 null hearts suppressed cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac remodeling in response to 2 independent pathological stressors, transverse aortic restriction and an activated calcineurin transgene. Most importantly, loss of miR-155 prevents the progress of heart failure and substantially extends the survival of calcineurin transgenic mice. The function of miR-155 in hypertrophy is confirmed in isolated cardiomyocytes. We identified jumonji, AT rich interactive domain 2 (Jarid2) as an miR-155 target in the heart. miR-155 directly represses Jarid2, whose expression is increased in miR-155 null hearts. Inhibition of endogenous Jarid2 partially rescues the effect of miR-155 loss in isolated cardiomyocytes. Our studies uncover miR-155 as an inducer of pathological cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and suggest that inhibition of endogenous miR-155 might have clinical potential to suppress cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.

24658854	Title	MicroRNA-124 inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis by directly repressing EZH2 in gastric cancer.
24658854	Abstract	MicroRNA-124 (miR-124), a pivotal member of the p53 network, was found to be down-regulated in multiple types of tumors and further reported as tumor suppressor microRNA. In this study, we found that miR-124 was down-regulated in gastric cancer cell lines and specimens. Restoration of miR-124 expression inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of gastric cancer cells. EZH2 (enhancer of zeste homolog 2), which has been shown to be an important transcription factor involved in the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells, was here confirmed to be a direct target gene of miR-124. On the other hand, silencing EZH2 also inhibits cell proliferation of gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, the treatment combining miR-124 with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) significantly showed more efficient anti-tumor effects than single treatment of miR-124 or 5-FU, and over-expression of miR-124 suppresses the tumor growth in vivo. Our study indicate that miR-124 can suppress gastric cancer cell growth by directly targeting the EZH2 gene and sensitize the treatment effect of 5-FU. Therefore, miR-124 shows tumor-suppressive activity and may be a new and useful approach of gastric cancer therapy.

24659669	Title	MicroRNA-21 stimulates gastric cancer growth and invasion by inhibiting the tumor suppressor effects of programmed cell death protein 4 and phosphatase and tensin homolog.
24659669	Abstract	MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is abnormally expressed in many solid cancers, such as gastric adenocarcinoma, and regulates some targets involved in cancer initiation and progression. In this study, we investigated the function of miR-21 in two gastric cancer cell lines, as well as its potential targeting of the tumor suppressor genes phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4). The first step was to use quantitative (q) RTPCR in order to verify the overexpression of miR-21 in two different gastric cancer cell lines (SGC-7901 and MKN-45) transfected with mIR-21 mimic. Western blotting confirmed the qRT-PCR data in a set of rescue experiments in which miR-21 mimic, inhibitor, and non specific mimic (NSM) were used to transfect the two gastric cancer cell lines. The protein levels of miR-21 targets PTEN and PDCD4 were estimated. Then, we evaluated its effect on tumor growth and invasion potential on the two different gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines. qRT-PCR results proved that miR-21 was overexpressed in gastric cancer cells transfected with miR-21 mimic. Western blot results further suggested that PTEN and PDCD4 were regulated by miR-21, as miR-21 inhibitor increased the expression of PTEN and PDCD4 proteins and significantly reduced cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In the control experiment miR-21 mimic significantly inhibited the expression of PTEN and PDCD4 proteins in the two gastric cell lines, leading to an increase in cell invasion and migration. Furthermore, miR-21 mimic inhibited the apoptosis of the two gastric cancer cell lines. miR-21 is overexpressed in gastric cancer and its aberrant expression may have important role in gastric cancer growth and dissemination by modulating the expression of the tumor suppressors PTEN and PDCD4, as well as by modulating the pathways involved in mediating cell growth, migration, invasion and apoptosis. Targeting miR-21 may help develop novel therapeutics for gastric cancer, once its pathophysiology is completely investigated.

24675462	Title	MiR-19a/b modulate the metastasis of gastric cancer cells by targeting the tumour suppressor MXD1.
24675462	Abstract	The microRNAs 19a and 19b, hereafter collectively referred to as miR-19a/b, were recognised to be the most important miRNAs in the oncomiRs-miR-17-92 cluster. However, the exact roles of miR-19a/b in cancers have not been elucidated. In the present study, miR-19a/b was found to be over-expressed in gastric cancer tissues and significantly associated with the patients' metastasis of gastric cancer. Using gain or loss-of-function in in vitro and in vivo experiments, a pro-metastatic function of miR-19a/b was observed in gastric cancer. Furthermore, reporter gene assay and western blot showed that MXD1 is a direct target of miR-19a/b. Functional assays showed that not only MXD1 had an opposite effect to miR-19a/b in the regulation of gastric cancer cells, but also overexpression of MXD1 reduced both miR-19a/b and c-Myc levels, indicating a potential positive feedback loop among miR-19a/b, MXD1 and c-Myc. In conclusion, miR-17-92 cluster members miR-19a/b facilitated gastric cancer cell migration, invasion and metastasis through targeting the antagonist of c-Myc -- MXD1, implicating a novel mechanism for the malignant phenotypes of gastric cancer.

24718681	Title	miR-375 inhibits Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinogenesis by blocking JAK2-STAT3 signaling.
24718681	Abstract	Gastric cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Although Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is considered to be a critical risk factor, the molecular mechanisms underlying H. pylori-induced gastric carcinogenesis are still poorly defined. Recently, accumulating studies have revealed that microRNAs play key roles in development, differentiation, immune regulation, and even carcinogenesis. This study was performed to explore the mechanism of microRNA-375 (miR-375) in H. pylori promotion of gastric carcinogenesis. It was shown that miR-375 was down-regulated in response to H. pylori infection in gastric epithelial cell lines; this finding was quite opposite to the expression patterns of pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in a co-culture cell model. Moreover, the ectopic expression of miR-375 aggravated cell proliferation and migration. It was further observed that Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) was a bona fide target of miR-375 and further activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and other downstream target molecules. Both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments showed that decreased miR-375 expression could mimic the oncogenic effects of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway. In addition, pretreatment with siRNAs targeting JAK2 prevented gastric epithelial cells from increasing proliferation and migration even in response to H. pylori infection. For the first time, our results demonstrate that the JAK2-STAT3 pathway regulated by miR-375 is involved in H. pylori-induced inflammation; this pathway promotes neoplastic transformation by affecting the expression of BCL-2 and TWIST1, hence offering a potential therapeutic target for inflammation-related cancers, especially those related to H. pylori.

24732377	Title	Down-regulation of miR-141 induced by helicobacter pylori promotes the invasion of gastric cancer by targeting STAT4.
24732377	Abstract	The association between Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric cancer has been identified recently. However, the molecular mechanism remained largely unknown. We found that miR-141 was decreased in Helicobacter pylori positive specimens (n=75) compared with negative tissues (n=75). The knockdown of miR-141 enhanced the invasion ability of gastric cancer cells; meanwhile, over-expression of miR-141 could inhibit the abilities of gastric cancer cells in vitro. A luciferase assay revealed that miR-141 was directly bound to the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR) of STAT4. STAT4 was found up-regulated at mRNA and protein levels, as shown by qRT-PCR and western blot. Over-expression of STAT4 was used to mimic miR-141 action in the invasion of gastric cancer. MiR-141 may play a pivotal role in controlling gastric cancer invasion through regulating STAT4 and maybe a potential target to treat gastric cancer.

24736504	Title	MicroRNA-338 inhibits growth, invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer by targeting NRP1 expression.
24736504	Abstract	NRP1 as multifunctional non-tyrosine-kinase receptors play critical roles in tumor progression. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an important class of pervasive genes that are involved in a variety of biological functions, particularly cancer. It remains unclear whether miRNAs can regulate the expression of NRP1. The goal of this study was to identify miRNAs that could inhibit the growth, invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer by targeting NRP1 expression. We found that miR-338 expression was reduced in gastric cancer cell lines and in gastric cancer tissues. Moreover, we found that miR-338 inhibited gastric cancer cell migration, invasion, proliferation and promoted apoptosis by targeting NRP1 expression. As an upstream regulator of NRP1, miR-338 directly targets NRP1. The forced expression of miR-338 inhibited the phosphorylation of Erk1/2, P38 MAPK and Akt; however, the expression of phosphorylated Erk1/2, P38 MAPK and Akt was restored by the overexpression of NRP1. In AGS cells infected with miR-338 or transfected with SiNRP1, the protein levels of fibronectin, vimentin, N-cadherin and SNAIL were decreased, but the expression of E-cadherin was increased. The expression of mesenchymal markers in miR-338-expressing cells was restored to normal levels by the restoration of NRP1 expression. In vivo, miR-338 also decreased tumor growth and suppressed D-MVA by targeting NRP1. Therefore, we conclude that miR-338 acts as a novel tumor suppressor gene in gastric cancer. miR-338 can decrease migratory, invasive, proliferative and apoptotic behaviors, as well as gastric cancer EMT, by attenuating the expression of NRP1.

24748184	Title	MicroRNA-194 inhibits the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in gastric cancer cells by targeting FoxM1.
24748184	Abstract	We hypothesized that miR-194 may control Forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1) expression in gastric cancer cells and therefore may have therapeutic potential in gastric cancer. The expression level of miR-194 was examined using real-time PCR in human gastric cancer and noncancerous gastric tissues, gastric cancer cell and normal gastric mucosal epithelial cell. We examined whether the miR-194 regulates cell migration and invasion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition Phenotype by inhibiting FoxM1 in gastric cancer cells. The expression of miR-194 was significantly lower in gastric cancer compared with non-cancerous gastric tissues and cells. Exogenous expression of miR-194 inhibited cell migration, invasion, and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition phenotype in gastric cancer cells. Moreover, we discovered a novel post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism of FoxM1 expression that is mediated by miR-194. Our study clearly demonstrates that miR-194 inhibits the acquisition of the EMT phenotype in gastric cancer cells by downregulating FoxM1, thereby inhibiting cell migration and invasion during cancer progression.

24755828	Title	MiR-21 expression in the tumor stroma of oral squamous cell carcinoma: an independent biomarker of disease free survival.
24755828	Abstract	Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients have a high mortality rate; thus, new clinical biomarkers and therapeutic options are needed. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short noncoding RNAs that regulate posttranscriptional gene expression and are commonly deregulated in OSCC and other cancers. MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is the most consistently overexpressed miRNA in several types of cancer, and it might be a useful clinical biomarker and therapeutic target. To better understand the role of miR-21 in OSCC, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples from 86 patients with primary OSCC were analyzed by in situ hybridization. We found that miR-21 was primarily expressed in the tumor stroma and in some tumor-associated blood vessels with no expression in the adjacent normal epithelia or stroma. Using image analysis, we quantitatively estimated miR-21 expression levels specifically in the stroma of a cohort of OSCC samples. These miR-21 levels significantly correlated with disease free survival with the highest levels being located in the stroma. Stromal miR-21 expression was independently associated with a poorer prognosis, even after adjusting for clinical parameters (perineural invasion and N-stage) in a multivariate analysis. In summary, we have shown that miR-21 is located in the carcinoma cells, stroma and blood vessels of tumors, and its expression specifically in the stromal compartment has a negative prognostic value in OSCC.

24759737	Title	Dysregulation in microRNA expression is associated with alterations in immune functions in combat veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder.
24759737	Abstract	While the immunological dysfunction in combat Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been well documented, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. The current study evaluated the role of microRNA (miR) in immunological dysfunction associated with PTSD. The presence of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and various lymphocyte subsets in blood collected from PTSD patients were analyzed. Our studies demonstrated that the numbers of both PBMC and various lymphocyte subsets increased significantly in PTSD patients. When T cells were further analyzed, the percentage of Th1 cells and Th17 cells increased, regulatory T cells(Tregs) decreased, while Th2 cells remained unaltered in PTSD patients. These data correlated with increased plasma levels of IFN-γ and IL-17 while IL-4 showed no significant change. The increase in PBMC counts, Th1 and Th17 cells seen in PTSD patients correlated with the clinical scores. High-throughput analysis of PBMCs for 1163 miRs showed that the expression of a significant number of miRs was altered in PTSD patients. Pathway analysis of dysregulated miRs seen in PTSD patients revealed relationship between selected miRNAs and genes that showed direct/indirect role in immunological signaling pathways consistent with the immunological changes seen in these patients. Of interest was the down-regulation of miR-125a in PTSD, which specifically targeted IFN-γ production. Together, the current study demonstrates for the first time that PTSD was associated with significant alterations in miRNAs, which may promote pro-inflammatory cytokine profile. Such epigenetic events may provide useful tools to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosis, and facilitate therapy of PTSD.

24760686	Title	MicroRNA-1 (miR-1) inhibits chordoma cell migration and invasion by targeting slug.
24760686	Abstract	Recent studies have revealed that expression of miRNA-1 (miR-1) is frequently down-regulated in several cancer types including chordoma. Identifying and validating novel targets of miR-1 is useful for understanding the roles of miR-1 in chordoma. We aimed to further investigate the functions of miR-1 in chordoma. Specifically, we assessed whether restoration of miR-1 affects cell migration and invasion in chordoma, and focused on the miR-1 potential target Slug gene. Migratory and invasive activities were assessed by wound healing and Matrigel invasion assays, respectively. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Slug expression was evaluated by Western blot, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. Restoration of miR-1 expression suppressed the migratory and invasive activities of chordoma cells. Transfection of miR-1 inhibited cell proliferation both time- and dose-dependently in chordoma. MiR-1 transfected cells showed inhibited Slug expression. Slug was over-expressed in chordoma cell lines and advanced chordoma tissues. In conclusion, we have shown that miR-1 directly targets the Slug gene in chordoma. Restoration of miR-1 suppressed not only proliferation, but also migratory and invasive activities, and reduced the Slug expression in chordoma cells. These results collectively indicate that miR-1/Slug pathway is a potential therapeutic target because of its crucial roles in chordoma cell growth and migration.

24762395	Title	p53 is positively regulated by miR-542-3p.
24762395	Abstract	The tumor suppressor p53 and miRNAs are linked through a complex network. Several miRNAs modulate p53 expression, while p53 regulates the transcription and/or biogenesis of several other miRNAs. Here, we report the development of a cell-based assay used with a library of human miRNA mimics in a high-throughput screen for miRNAs that modulate p53 expression. Overexpression of miRNA (miR)-542-3p in cancer cells elevated p53 expression, stimulated the expression of p53 targets, and inhibited cell proliferation. Mechanistically, miR-542-3p increased p53 protein stability by weakening interactions between p53 and its negative regulator MDM2. Furthermore, miR-542-3p suppressed ribosome biogenesis by downregulating a subset of ribosomal proteins such as RPS23, leading to upregulation of RPL11 and stabilization of p53. The 3'untranslated region in the RPS23 transcript contained a miR-542-3p-binding site, suggesting that RPS23 is a direct target of miR-542-3p. Our results define miR-542-3p as an important new positive regulator of p53 with potential applications in cancer treatment.

24762440	Title	ZEB1 sensitizes lung adenocarcinoma to metastasis suppression by PI3K antagonism.
24762440	Abstract	Epithelial tumor cells that have undergone epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are typically prone to metastasis and drug resistance and contribute to a poor clinical outcome. The transcription factor ZEB1 is a known driver of EMT, and mediators of ZEB1 represent potential therapeutic targets for metastasis suppression. Here, we have shown that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-targeted (PI3K-targeted) therapy suppresses metastasis in a mouse model of Kras/Tp53-mutant lung adenocarcinoma that develops metastatic disease due to high expression of ZEB1. In lung adenocarcinoma cells from Kras/Tp53-mutant animals and human lung cancer cell lines, ZEB1 activated PI3K by derepressing miR-200 targets, including amphiregulin (AREG), betacellulin (BTC), and the transcription factor GATA6, which stimulated an EGFR/ERBB2 autocrine loop. Additionally, ZEB1-dependent derepression of the miR-200 and miR-183 target friend of GATA 2 (FOG2) enhanced GATA3-induced expression of the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K. Knockdown of FOG2, p110α, and RHEB ameliorated invasive and metastatic propensities of tumor cells. Surprisingly, FOG2 was not required for mesenchymal differentiation, suggesting that mesenchymal differentiation and invasion are distinct and separable processes. Together, these results indicate that ZEB1 sensitizes lung adenocarcinoma cells to metastasis suppression by PI3K-targeted therapy and suggest that treatments to selectively modify the metastatic behavior of mesenchymal tumor cells are feasible and may be of clinical value.

24763054	Title	MicroRNA-185 regulates chemotherapeutic sensitivity in gastric cancer by targeting apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain.
24763054	Abstract	Gastric cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Resistance to chemotherapy is a significant barrier for effective cancer treatment. Here, we identified miR-185 to be a contributor to chemosensitivity in gastric cancer. We observed low levels of miR-185 in gastric cancer cell lines and clinical tissues, compared with gastric epithelium cell line and noncancerous tissues. Furthermore, enforced expression of miR-185 increased the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to low-dose chemotherapeutic agents, which alone cannot trigger significant apoptosis. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous miR-185 prevented high-dose chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In elucidating the molecular mechanism by which miR-185 participated in the regulation of chemosensitivity in gastric cancer, we discovered that apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC) is a direct target of miR-185. The role of miR-185 was confirmed in gastric tumor xenograft model. The growth of established tumors was suppressed by a combination therapy using enforced miR-185 expression and a low dose of anticancer drugs. Finally, we found that RUNX3 (Runt-related transcription factor) was involved in the activation of miR-185 at the transcriptional level. Taken together, our results reveal that RUNX3, miR-185 and ARC regulate the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to chemotherapy.

24763883	Title	Down-regulation of microRNA-205 promotes gastric cancer cell proliferation.
24763883	Abstract	Increasing evidence indicates that MicroRNAs, a class of small RNA molecules, play crucial roles in tumorigenesis, through affecting cell proliferation, apoptosis and metastasis. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of miR-205 on gastric cancer cell proliferation. The expression of miR-205 was examined in the gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. BrdU incorporation assay was used to measure the cell proliferation. Western blot was performed to determine the protein expression. miR-205 is significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues, compared with adjacent normal tissues. Besides, miR-205 expression is associated with clinical and pathological characteristics of patients. In vitro studies further found that inhibition of miR-205 significantly promoted gastric cancer cell proliferation via cell-cycle progression. Further analyses indicated that miR-205 was able to repress oncoprotein Yin Yang 1 expression, through targeting its 3'-untranlated region. Our data suggest that down-regulation of miR-205 may represent an important mechanism for the development of gastric cancer.

24767251	Title	Involvement of miR-29b signaling in the sensitivity to chemotherapy in patients with ovarian carcinoma.
24767251	Abstract	Although the molecular mechanisms driving chemoresistance and relapse of ovarian cancer have been widely studied, the key molecules have not been identified. In this study, the expression of miR-29b messenger RNA (mRNA) and its targeted genes, myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1, mitogen-activated protein kinase 10 (MAPK10), and autophagy-related protein 9A (ATG9A), were investigated in ovarian carcinomas, and their associations with clinicopathological characteristics and survival of patients with ovarian cancer were analyzed. The protein expression of MCL1, MAPK10, and ATG9A was measured using immunohistochemistry. miR-29b mRNA and ATG9A gene mRNA levels were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results demonstrated that the percentage of MCL1, MAPK10, and ATG9A protein-positive cases were significantly higher, whereas miR-29b was significantly lower in ovarian serous, mucinous, and clear cell carcinomas than that in normal tissues. MAPK10 was significantly associated with higher histopathologic grading. The percentage of positive myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1, ATG9A, and MAPK10 protein expression and low miR-29b mRNA expression were significantly higher in cases with clinical stage III and IV ovarian cancer than in cases with clinical stage II ovarian cancer. High ATG9A protein and low miR-29b mRNA expression were significantly associated with relapse. Univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis showed a negative correlation between MAPK10 or ATG9A protein expression and overall as well as progression-free survival, whereas a positive correlation was observed between miR-29b mRNA expression and overall as well as progression-free survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that elevated MAPK10 or ATG9A protein and lowered miR-29b mRNA expression in ovarian carcinoma was an independent poor prognostic predictor. Our study suggested that miR-29b mRNA, MAPK10 protein expression, and ATG9A protein expression are closely related to chemosensitivity of ovarian carcinoma.

24768205	Title	A long noncoding RNA activated by TGF-β promotes the invasion-metastasis cascade in hepatocellular carcinoma.
24768205	Abstract	The role of TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cell dissemination is well established, but the involvement of lncRNAs in TGF-β signaling is still unknown. In this study, we observed that the lncRNA-activated by TGF-β (lncRNA-ATB) was upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) metastases and associated with poor prognosis. lncRNA-ATB upregulated ZEB1 and ZEB2 by competitively binding the miR-200 family and then induced EMT and invasion. In addition, lncRNA-ATB promoted organ colonization of disseminated tumor cells by binding IL-11 mRNA, autocrine induction of IL-11, and triggering STAT3 signaling. Globally, lncRNA-ATB promotes the invasion-metastasis cascade. Thus, these findings suggest that lncRNA-ATB, a mediator of TGF-β signaling, could predispose HCC patients to metastases and may serve as a potential target for antimetastatic therapies. 

24768995	Title	Tumour-suppressive microRNA-224 inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion via targeting oncogenic TPD52 in prostate cancer.
24768995	Abstract	Our recent study of the microRNA expression signature of prostate cancer (PCa) revealed that microRNA-224 (miR-224) is significantly downregulated in PCa tissues. Here, we found that restoration of miR-224 significantly inhibits PCa cell migration and invasion. Additionally, we found that oncogenic TPD52 is a direct target of miR-224 regulation. Silencing of the TPD52 gene significantly inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion. Moreover, TPD52 expression is upregulated in cancer tissues and negatively correlates with miR-224 expression. We conclude that loss of tumour-suppressive miR-224 enhances cancer cell migration and invasion in PCa through direct regulation of oncogenic TPD52.

24769353	Title	Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) regulated by miR-200b contributes to multi-drug resistance of small cell lung cancer.
24769353	Abstract	Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 2 (ZEB2) was closely related to the oncogenesis, development and response to chemotherapy of cancer. However, its biological functions in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) remain unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the roles of ZEB2 in chemoresistance of SCLC and its possible molecular mechanism. Expression of ZEB2 was examined in sixty-eight cases of SCLC tissues by immunohistochemistry. Knockdown of ZEB2 was carried out in SCLC multidrug resistant cells (H69AR) to assess its influence on chemoresistance. The results showed that ZEB2 was expressed in 23.5% (16/68) of SCLC. Overexpression of ZEB2 was associated with the poor pathologic stage of SCLC (P < 0.001 by the Fisher's Exact Test) and the shorter survival time (by the Kaplan-Meier method). Inhibition of ZEB2 expression using small interfering RNA in H69AR cells sensitized cancer cells to chemotherapeutic drugs through increasing drug-induced cell apoptosis accompanied with S phase arrest. In silico analysis demonstrated that there are complementary binding sites between miR-200b and ZEB2 3'-UTR, and identified miR-200b as a potential regulator of ZEB2. We found that miR-200b was down-regulated in the resistant cells and enforced expression of miR-200b by miRNA mimics increased cell sensitivity. Overexpression of miR-200b led to the downregulation of ZEB2 at protein level. Luciferase reporter gene assay showed that 3'UTR ZEB2 activity was regulated by miR-200b. Our results suggest that ZEB2 modulates drug resistance and is regulated by miR-200b. All findings provide insight into the ZEB2 signaling mechanism and ZEB2 may be a potentially novel target for multi-drug resistance in SCLC.

24771630	Title	Differentiating soft tissue leiomyosarcoma and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma: A miRNA analysis.
24771630	Abstract	The rare and highly aggressive adult soft tissue sarcomas leiomyosarcoma (LMS) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) contain complex genomes characterized by a multitude of rearrangements, amplifications, and deletions. Differential diagnosis remains a challenge. MicroRNA (miRNA) profiling was conducted on a series of LMS and UPS samples to initially investigate the differential expression and to identify specific signatures useful for improving the differential diagnosis. Initially, 10 high-grade LMS and 10 high-grade UPS were profiled with a miRNA microarray. Two cultured human mesenchymal stem cell samples were used as controls. 38 and 46 miRNAs classified UPS and LMS samples, respectively, into separate groups compared to control samples. When comparing the two profiles, miR-199b-5p, miR-320a, miR-199a-3p, miR-126, miR-22 were differentially expressed. These were validated by RT-PCR on a further series of 27 UPS and 21 LMS for a total of 68 cases. The levels of miR-199-5p and miR-320a, in particular, confirmed the microarray data, the former highly expressed in UPS and the latter in LMS. Immunohistochemistry was performed on all 68 cases to confirm original diagnosis. Recently reported LMS- and UPS-associated genes were correlated with miRNA targets based on target algorithms of three databases. Several genes including IMP3, ROR2, MDM2, CDK4, and UPA, are targets of differentially expressed miRNAs. We identified miRNA expression patterns in LMS and UPS, linking them to chromosomal regions and mRNA targets known to be involved in tumor development/progression of LMS and UPS.

24777293	Title	miR-145 inhibits migration and invasion of glioma stem cells by targeting ABCG2.
24777293	Abstract	Despite advances in clinical therapies and technologies, the prognosis for patients with malignant glioma is poor. Our previous research demonstrated that glioma stem cells (GSCs) were crucial for glioma malignancy and accelerated tumor migration and invasion. The migration and invasion of malignant glioma cells into the surrounding normal brain tissues cause the poor outcome. miR-145, a miRNA found to be expressed in neurons, was recently found to have reduced expression in glioblastoma multiforme tumors. And miR-145 loss in glioma cells led to increased cell proliferation and invasion. However, its function on the migration and invasion of GSCs was still unknown. In this study, we aimed to identify the effects and mechanisms of miR-145 on the migration and invasion of GSCs. Our investigations revealed that miR-145 was low expressed in malignant glioma tissues and their corresponding GSCs. Knockdown of miR-145 in vitro could enhance the migration and invasion of GSCs, while up-regulation of miR-145 had the opposite effects. Further investigation of the potential mechanism demonstrated that the function of miR-145 in regulating the migration and invasion of GSCs is mediated by its targeting of ABCG2 mRNA. ABCG2 is an ATP-binding cassette transporter protein, which was identified to be overexpressed in GSCs and higher-grade glioma tissues. We found that miR-145 was negative correlated with ABCG2 levels in GSCs, and reduction in ABCG2 expression decreased the cell migration and invasion of GSCs. Further, a luciferase reporter proved that ABCG2 was a direct target of miR-145 in GSCs. Thus, these findings underscore the potential of miR-145 to regulate the migration and invasion of GSCs through targeting ABCG2.

24778118	Title	Staphylococcal enterotoxin B-induced microRNA-155 targets SOCS1 to promote acute inflammatory lung injury.
24778118	Abstract	Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) causes food poisoning in humans. It is considered a biological weapon, and inhalation can trigger lung injury and sometimes respiratory failure. Being a superantigen, SEB initiates an exaggerated inflammatory response. While the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in immune cell activation is getting increasing recognition, their role in the regulation of inflammatory disease induced by SEB has not been studied. In this investigation, we demonstrate that exposure to SEB by inhalation results in acute inflammatory lung injury accompanied by an altered miRNA expression profile in lung-infiltrating cells. Among the miRNAs that were significantly elevated, miR-155 was the most overexpressed. Interestingly, miR-155(-/-) mice were protected from SEB-mediated inflammation and lung injury. Further studies revealed a functional link between SEB-induced miR-155 and proinflammatory cytokine gamma interferon (IFN-γ). Through the use of bioinformatics tools, suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), a negative regulator of IFN-γ, was identified as a potential target of miR-155. While miR-155(-/-) mice displayed increased expression of Socs1, the overexpression of miR-155 led to its suppression, thereby enhancing IFN-γ levels. Additionally, the inhibition of miR-155 resulted in restored Socs1expression. Together, our data demonstrate an important role for miR-155 in promoting SEB-mediated inflammation in the lungs through Socs1 suppression and suggest that miR-155 may be an important target in preventing SEB-mediated inflammation and tissue injury.

24780186	Title	MicroRNA-152 targets ADAM17 to suppress NSCLC progression.
24780186	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that have been suggested to play an essential role in tumorigenesis. In this study, we show that miR-152 is significantly downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and cell lines. Restoration of miR-152 significantly reduces proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells. In addition, ADAM metallopeptidase domain 17 (ADAM17) is identified as a target of miR-152 in NSCLC cells, and miR-152-induced suppression of cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion is partially mediated by silencing of ADAM17 expression. Furthermore, ADAM17 inversely correlates with miR-152 in NSCLC tissues. Collectively, our findings indicate that miR-152 acts as tumor suppressor in NSCLC partially via targeting ADAM17.

To gain an insight into the new biomarkers and molecular mechanisms of chronic benzene poisoning, miRNA profiles and mRNA expression pattern from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of chronic benzene poisoning patients and health controls matched age and gender without benzene exposure were performed using the Exiqon miRNA PCR ARRAY and Gene Chip Human Gene 2.0ST Arrays, respectively. Totally, 6 up-regulated miRNAs (miR-34a, miR-205, miR-10b, let-7d, miR-185 and miR-423-5p-2) and 7 down-regulated miRNAs (miR-133a, miR-543, hsa-miR-130a, miR-27b,miR-223, miR-142-5p and miR-320b) were found in chronic benzene poisoning group compared to health controls (P ≤ 0.05). By integrating miRNA and mRNA expression data, these differential miRNAs were mainly involved in regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, axon guidance, regulation of transcription, DNA-dependent, nervous system development, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization. Further, pathway analysis indicated that SMAD4, PLCB1, NFAT5, GNAI2, PTEN, VEGFA, BCL2, CTNNB1 and CCND1 were key target genes of differential miRNAs which were implicated in Adherens junction, TGF-beta signaling pathway, Wnt signaling pathway, tight junction and Pathways in cancer. In conclusion, the aberrant miRNAs might be a potential biomarker of chronic benzene poisoning.

24784704	Title	Blood microRNA profile associates with the levels of serum lipids and metabolites associated with glucose metabolism and insulin resistance and pinpoints pathways underlying metabolic syndrome: the cardiovascular risk in Young Finns Study.
24784704	Abstract	Since metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a collection of cardiovascular risk factors involving multiple signaling systems, we related the metabolic abnormalities associated with MetS with circulating microRNA profiles to pinpoint the affected signaling pathways. The blood microRNA profile, genome wide gene expression and serum NMR metabolomics were analyzed from 71 participants of the Young Finns Study. We found nine microRNAs that associated significantly with metabolites connected to MetS. MicroRNA-144-5p concentration correlated with glucose levels, hsa-1207-5p with glycosylated hemoglobin and hsa-miR-484 with metabolites related to insulin resistance. Hsa-miR-625-3p correlated with cholesterol levels, hsa-miR-1237-3p and hsa-miR-331-3p expression with certain fatty acids levels and hsa-miR-129-1-3p, -129-2-3p, and -1288-3p with glycerol levels. The down-regulated targets of miR-1207-5p and -129-2-3p were enriched in PI3K and MAPK pathways and 8 out of the 12 enriched pathways were down-regulated in individuals with MetS. In conclusion microRNAs associated with several aspects of MetS, possibly regulating glucose and lipid metabolism.

24784921	Title	Prognostic value of microRNA-223/epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 signaling in patients with osteosarcoma.
24784921	Abstract	MicroRNA-223 (miR-223) has been demonstrated to be implicated in cell proliferation and cell cycle progression of osteosarcoma cell lines by regulating its target gene epithelial cell transforming sequence 2 (ECT2). However, the clinical significance of the deregulation of the miR-223/Ect2 axis in human osteosarcoma has not been fully elucidated. To address this problem, we firstly showed that the expression levels of miR-223 and Ect2 messenger RNA were, respectively, down-regulated and up-regulated in osteosarcoma tissues compared with those in noncancerous bone tissues significantly (both P < .001), according to the results of quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Notably, miR-223 down-regulation was negatively correlated with Ect2 messenger RNA up-regulation in osteosarcoma tissues (r = -0.68, P = .01). Then, the combined low miR-223 expression and high Ect2 expression (miR-223-low/Ect2-high) was significantly associated with high tumor grade (P = .01), poor response to chemotherapy (P = .01), positive metastasis (P < .001), and recurrence (P < .001) of osteosarcomas. Moreover, patients with miR-223-low/Ect2-high expression had the shortest overall survival (P < .001) and disease-free survival (P < .001) compared with patients in the other 3 groups (miR-223-low/Ect2-low, miR-223-high/Ect2-high, and miR-223-high/Ect2-low). Furthermore, the multivariate analysis identified miR-223/Ect2 expression and the status of metastasis as independent prognostic factors for overall survival and disease-free survival. In conclusion, our data offer convincing evidence that the deregulation of miR-223 and its target gene ECT2 may be associated with the aggressive tumor progression of human osteosarcoma. Of note, the combined miR-223 down-regulation and Ect2 up-regulation may be a possible marker of poor prognosis in this malignancy.

24785373	Title	MiR-224 expression increases radiation sensitivity of glioblastoma cells.
24785373	Abstract	Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and highly aggressive primary malignant brain tumor. The intrinsic resistance of this brain tumor limits the efficacy of administered treatment like radiation therapy. In the present study, effect of miR-224 expression on growth characteristics of established GBM cell lines was analyzed. MiR-224 expression in the cell lines as well as in primary GBM tumor tissues was found to be low. Exogenous transient expression of miR-224 using either synthetic mimics or stable inducible expression using doxycycline inducible lentiviral vector carrying miR-224 gene, was found to bring about 30-55% reduction in clonogenic potential of U87 MG cells. MiR-224 expression reduced clonogenic potential of U87 MG cells by 85-90% on irradiation at a dose of 6Gy, a dose that brought about 50% reduction in clonogenic potential in the absence of miR-224 expression. MiR-224 expression in glioblastoma cells resulted in 55-65% reduction in the expression levels of API5 gene, a known target of miR-224. Further, siRNA mediated down-regulation of API5 was also found to have radiation sensitizing effect on glioblastoma cell lines. Analysis of the Cancer Genome Atlas data showed lower miR-224 expression levels in male GBM patients to correlate with poorer survival. Higher expression levels of miR-224 target API5 also showed significant correlation with poorer survival of GBM patients. Up-regulation of miR-224 or down-regulation of its target API5 in combination with radiation therapy, therefore appear as promising options for the treatment of glioblastoma, which is refractory to the existing treatment strategies.

24786790	Title	Prolyl isomerase Pin1 acts downstream of miR200c to promote cancer stem-like cell traits in breast cancer.
24786790	Abstract	Breast cancer stem-like cells (BCSC) have been implicated in tumor growth, metastasis, drug resistance, and relapse but druggable targets in appropriate subsets of this cell population have yet to be identified. Here we identify a fundamental role for the prolyl isomerase Pin1 in driving BCSC expansion, invasiveness, and tumorigenicity, defining it as a key target of miR200c, which is known to be a critical regulator in BCSC. Pin1 overexpression expanded the growth and tumorigenicity of BCSC and triggered epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Conversely, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Pin1 reduced the abundance and self-renewal activity of BCSC. Moreover, moderate overexpression of miR200c-resistant Pin1 rescued the BCSC defect in miR200c-expressing cells. Genetic deletion of Pin1 also decreased the abundance and repopulating capability of normal mouse mammary stem cells. In human cells, freshly isolated from reduction mammoplasty tissues, Pin1 overexpression endowed BCSC traits to normal breast epithelial cells, expanding both luminal and basal/myoepithelial lineages in these cells. In contrast, Pin1 silencing in primary breast cancer cells freshly isolated from clinical samples inhibited the expansion, self-renewal activity, and tumorigenesis of BCSC in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our work demonstrated that Pin1 is a pivotal regulator acting downstream of miR200c to drive BCSC and breast tumorigenicity, highlighting a new therapeutic target to eradicate BCSC.

24788845	Title	Downregulation of miR-101-3p by hepatitis B virus promotes proliferation and migration of hepatocellular carcinoma cells by targeting Rab5a.
24788845	Abstract	RAB GTPase 5A (RAB5A), a member of the Rab subfamily of small GTPases, acts as an oncogene and has been associated with various key cellular functions, including cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and angiogenesis. Recently, it has been reported that the Rab5a gene is involved in the progression of cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common and aggressive cancers, and it is usually associated with persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections. Emerging evidence suggests that HBV alters microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles, but the mechanisms underlying this process have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we examine how HBV affects the production of miR-101-1, which has been shown to be downregulated in HCC. We found that HBV could repress miR-101-3p by inhibiting its promoter activity. Downregulation of miR-101-3p promoted cancer cell growth and migration, and a specific miR-101-3p inhibitor was able to enhance proliferation and migration. Moreover, we identified Rab5a was one of the target genes of miR-101-3p in HBV-related HCC. Forced expression of miR-101-3p in liver cell lines resulted in a marked reduction of the expression of Rab5a at both the mRNA and protein level by directly targeting the 3'untranslated region of Rab5a. Overexpression of Rab5a resulted in a reversal of the suppression of proliferation and migration of SMMC-7721 cells mediated by miR-101-3p. Taken together, our data show that HBV can downregulate miR-101-3p expression by inhibiting its promoter activity and that downregulation of miR-101-3p promotes HCC cell proliferation and migration by targeting Rab5a. This provides new insights into the mechanisms of HBV-related HCC pathogenesis.

24789793	Title	Transcriptional suppression of miR-181c by hepatitis C virus enhances homeobox A1 expression.
24789793	Abstract	Hepatitis C virus (HCV)-induced chronic liver disease is one of the leading causes of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The molecular events leading to HCC following chronic HCV infection remain poorly defined. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the control of many biological processes, and their deregulation is associated with different viral infections. In this study, we observed that HCV infection of hepatocytes transcriptionally downregulates miR-181c expression by modulating CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (C/EBP-β). Reduced expression of the pri-miR-181c transcript was noted following HCV infection. In silico prediction suggests that homeobox A1 (HOXA1) is a direct target of miR-181c. HOXA1 is a member of the homeodomain-containing transcription factor family and possesses pivotal roles in normal growth, development, and differentiation of mammalian tissues. Our results demonstrated that HOXA1 expression is enhanced in HCV-infected hepatocytes. Exogenous expression of the miR-181c mimic inhibits HOXA1 and its downstream molecules STAT3 and STAT5, which are involved in cell growth regulation. Interestingly, overexpression of miR-181c inhibited HCV replication by direct binding with E1 and NS5A sequences. Furthermore, accumulation of HCV genotype 2a RNA with miR-181c was observed in an RNA-induced silencing complex in Huh7.5 cells. Our results provide new mechanistic insights into the role of miR-181c in HCV-hepatocyte interactions, and miR-181c may act as a target for therapeutic intervention. Importance: Chronic HCV infection is one of the major causes of end-stage liver disease, including hepatocellular carcinoma. An understanding of the molecular mechanisms of HCV-mediated hepatocyte growth promotion is necessary for therapeutic intervention against HCC. In this study, we have provided evidence of HCV-mediated transcriptional downregulation of miR-181c. HCV-infected liver biopsy specimens also displayed lower expression levels of miR-181c. We have further demonstrated that inhibition of miR-181c upregulates homeobox A1 (HOXA1), which is important for hepatocyte growth promotion. Exogenous expression of miR-181c inhibited HCV replication by directly binding with HCV E1 and NS5A sequences. Taken together, our results provided new mechanistic insights for an understanding of the role of miR-181c in HCV-hepatocyte interactions and revealed miR-181c as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.

24789910	Title	MicroRNA-486-dependent modulation of DOCK3/PTEN/AKT signaling pathways improves muscular dystrophy-associated symptoms.
24789910	Abstract	Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding dystrophin, which results in dysfunctional signaling pathways within muscle. Previously, we identified microRNA-486 (miR-486) as a muscle-enriched microRNA that is markedly reduced in the muscles of dystrophin-deficient mice (Dmdmdx-5Cv mice) and in DMD patient muscles. Here, we determined that muscle-specific transgenic overexpression of miR-486 in muscle of Dmdmdx-5Cv mice results in reduced serum creatine kinase levels, improved sarcolemmal integrity, fewer centralized myonuclei, increased myofiber size, and improved muscle physiology and performance. Additionally, we identified dedicator of cytokinesis 3 (DOCK3) as a miR-486 target in skeletal muscle and determined that DOCK3 expression is induced in dystrophic muscles. DOCK3 overexpression in human myotubes modulated PTEN/AKT signaling, which regulates muscle hypertrophy and growth, and induced apoptosis. Furthermore, several components of the PTEN/AKT pathway were markedly modulated by miR-486 in dystrophin-deficient muscle. Skeletal muscle-specific miR-486 overexpression in Dmdmdx-5Cv animals decreased levels of DOCK3, reduced PTEN expression, and subsequently increased levels of phosphorylated AKT, which resulted in an overall beneficial effect. Together, these studies demonstrate that stable overexpression of miR-486 ameliorates the disease progression of dystrophin-deficient skeletal muscle.

24790458	Title	MiR-519d represses ovarian cancer cell proliferation and enhances cisplatin-mediated cytotoxicity in vitro by targeting XIAP.
24790458	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNAs that are believed to play fundamental roles in tumorigenesis and tumor development at the posttranscriptional level, as negative regulators of gene expression. This study was designed to evaluate the expression and anticancer effect of miR-519d in ovarian cancer. The expression levels of miR-519d in ovarian cancer cells and tissues were detected by TaqMan quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (TaqMan qRT-PCR; Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The effects of miR-519d on ovarian cancer cell proliferation and cisplatin chemosensitivity were analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, flow cytometry, and Western blotting assay. A luciferase reporter assay was performed to validate the miR-519d binding sites on the 3' untranslated region of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). The expression levels of XIAP mRNA and protein were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting assay, respectively. miR-519d was significantly downregulated in human ovarian cancer cell lines and tissues. Overexpression of miR-519d in ovarian cancer cells decreased cell proliferation and sensitized ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin-induced cell death accompanied by increased activation of caspase 3 and cleavage of poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase 1. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that XIAP was a putative target of miR-519d. Overexpression of miR-519d decreased XIAP expression at both the protein and mRNA levels. In contrast, inhibition of miR-519d increased XIAP expression. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed XIAP as a direct target of miR-519d. XIAP mRNA and protein expression levels were inversely correlated with miR-519d expression in ovarian cancer cell lines and tissues. These findings indicate that miR-519d suppresses cell proliferation and sensitizes ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin-induced cell death by targeting the XIAP transcript, suggesting that miR-519d plays a tumor-suppressive role in human ovarian cancer and highlighting the therapeutic potential of miR-519d in ovarian cancer treatment.

24792185	Title	PDGF-regulated miRNA-138 inhibits the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.
24792185	Abstract	Differentiation-specific microRNAs may play a critical role in MSC differentiation, and they can be altered by PDGF signaling. We propose that PDGF modulates MSC differentiation by regulating microRNA expression. Therefore, we investigated whether PDGF treatment could alter the expression profile of miRNAs in MSCs. Furthermore, we assessed the osteoblast phenotype of MSCs after inducing osteogenic differentiation. We found that PDGF treatment significantly inhibits the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and that miR-138 gene transcription is controlled by PDGF signaling. Our results confirm that miR-138 inhibits the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs and suppresses the phosphorylation of FAK, ERK1/2, and Runx2. Furthermore, our study clearly demonstrates that downregulation of Runx2 by miR-138 is critical for the PDGF-mediated inhibition of osteogenic differentiation of MSCs. These findings indicate that inhibition of miR-138 function in MSCs, either by treatment with anti-miR-138 or by overexpression of the miR-138 target sequence (miRNA sponge), could represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of bone homeostasis disorders caused by activation of the PDGF pathway.

24792245	Title	Identification of microRNAs involved in the modulation of pro-angiogenic factors in atherosclerosis by a polyphenol-rich extract from propolis.
24792245	Abstract	New vessel formation plays a critical role in the progression and vulnerability of atherosclerotic lesions. It has been shown that polyphenols from propolis attenuate the progression of atherosclerosis and also exert inhibitory effects on angiogenic factors. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not completely understood. Thus, this study aimed to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in the modulation of pro-angiogenic factors in the atherosclerotic plaques of LDL receptor gene knockout mice treated with a polyphenol-rich extract of Chilean propolis. The progression of the atherosclerotic lesions was significantly attenuated in treated mice compared with control mice. Using microarray analysis and a bioinformatic approach, we identified 29 differentially expressed miRNAs. Many of these miRNAs were involved in biological processes associated with angiogenesis, such as the cell cycle, cell migration, cell growth and proliferation. Among them, three miRNAs (miR-181a, miR-106a and miR-20b) were over-expressed and inversely related to the expression of Vegfa (vascular endothelial growth factor A) and Hif1a (hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha). In addition, VEGF-A protein expression was attenuated in histological sections obtained from the aortic sinuses of treated mice. VEGFA is a key pro-angiogenic factor in atherosclerotic plaques, and Hif1a, which is expressed in the necrotic nucleus of the atheroma, is its main inducer. We found a correlation between the over-expression of miR-181a, miR-106a and miR-20b and their target genes, Hif1a and Vegfa, which is consistent with attenuation of the atherosclerotic lesion. In conclusion, our data analysis provides evidence that the anti-angiogenic effects of polyphenols from Chilean propolis can be modulated by miRNAs, in particular miR-181a, miR-106a and miR-20b.

24792516	Title	Post-transcriptional regulation by miR-137 underlies the low abundance of CAR and low rate of bilirubin clearance in neonatal mice.
24792516	Abstract	Jaundice, potentially fatal encephalopathy, is common in approximately two-thirds of all well term infants. It is largely due to low expression of constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) in newborns; however, the mechanisms for this low expression were poorly understood. Expression of miR-137 and CAR was compared between neonatal and adult mice and between healthy and a mouse model of obstructive jaundice (OJ) using real-time RT-PCR and Western blot methods. Rate of bilirubin clearance was measured. DNA methylation of miR-137 was analyzed. Inverse expressions of miR-137 and CAR were consistently observed between newborn and adult mice, with a significantly higher miR-137 level and lower CAR protein and mRNA levels in neonatal liver than in adult liver. Similar reciprocal relationship was found existing between adult OJ mice and healthy control animals with a higher miR-137 level and lower CAR protein and mRNA levels in OJ than in healthy mice. Forced expression of miR-137 in primary hepatocytes repressed CAR protein levels, which was prevented by the inhibitor of miR-137. Knockdown of endogenous miR-137 by its inhibitor increased the rate of bilirubin clearance in OJ mice. Finally, we found that miR-137 was epigenetically over-activated due to hypomethylation in neonatal mice and in adult OJ mice, relative to adult healthy animals. Our findings indicate that miR-137 is a repressor of CAR and thus a critical determinant of bilirubin clearance and may be considered a molecular target for the treatment of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

24793973	Title	MiR-31 is an independent prognostic factor and functions as an oncomir in cervical cancer via targeting ARID1A.
24793973	Abstract	MicroRNAs(miRNAs) play important roles in tumor development and progression. The purposes of this study were to investigate the role of miR-31 in cervical cancer and clarified the regulation of ARID1A by miR-31. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to examine miR-31 expression in cervical cancer cell lines and patient specimens. The clinicopathological significance of miR-31 upregulation was further analyzed. The MTT, colony formation, apoptosis, cell cycle, wound healing and Transwell invasion assays, and a xenograft model were performed. A luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm the target gene of miR-31, and the results were validated in cell lines and patient specimens. MiR-31 was significantly up-regulated in cervical cancer cell lines and clinical tissues. The high miR-31 level was significantly correlated with higher FIGO stage, node metastasis, vascular involvement and deep stromal invasion. Patients with high expression of miR-31 had poorer overall survival than patients with low expression. MiR-31 was an independent prognostic factor in cervical cancer in multivariate Cox regression analysis. Down-regulation of miR-31 impaired cell proliferation, colony formation, and cell migration and invasion in vitro, and inhibited xenograft tumor growth in vivo. ARID1A was verified as a direct target of miR-31, which was further confirmed by the inverse expression of miR-31 and ARID1A in patient specimens. The newly identified miR-31/ARID1A pathway provides insight into cervical cancer progression, and may represent a novel therapeutic target.

24796666	Title	The RNA-binding protein PCBP2 facilitates gastric carcinoma growth by targeting miR-34a.
24796666	Abstract	Gastric carcinoma is the fourth most common cancer worldwide, with a high rate of death and low 5-year survival rate. However, the mechanism underling gastric cancer is still not fully understood. Here in the present study, we identify the RNA-binding protein PCBP2 as an oncogenic protein in human gastric carcinoma. Our results show that PCBP2 is up-regulated in human gastric cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, and that high level of PCBP2 predicts poor overall and disease-free survival. Knockdown of PCBP2 in gastric cancer cells inhibits cell proliferation and colony formation in vitro, whereas opposing results are obtained when PCBP2 is overexpressed. Our in vivo subcutaneous xenograft results also show that PCBP2 can critically regulate gastric cancer cell growth. In addition, we find that PCBP2-depletion induces apoptosis in gastric cancer cells via up-regulating expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and down-regulating anti-apoptotic proteins. Mechanically, we identify that miR-34a as a target of PCBP2, and that miR-34a is critically essential for the function of PCBP2. In summary, PCBP2 promotes gastric carcinoma development by regulating the level of miR-34a.

24798023	Title	MicroRNA-9 regulates neural apoptosis in methylmalonic acidemia via targeting BCL2L11.
24798023	Abstract	Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is an autosomal-recessive inborn metabolic disorder that results from a deficiency in methylmalonyl-coenzyme A mutase or its cofactor, adenosylcobalamin. Currently, neurological manifestations in MMA are thought to be associated with neural apoptosis. BCL2L11, which is a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, is resident in the outer mitochondrial membrane, where this protein acts as a central regulator of the intrinsic apoptotic cascade and mediates excitotoxic apoptosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs that function as endogenous triggers of the RNA interference pathway. Currently, little is known regarding the role of miRNA in MMA. In our previous study, we preliminarily found that the expression of miR-9 was significantly down-regulated in MMA patient plasma and sensitively changed after VitB12 treatment, which may act as a potential "competitor" of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the diagnosis of MMA. In the present study, we first confirmed that miR-9 inhibited BCL2L11 expression by directly targeting its 3'-untranslated region, and the up-regulation of miR-9 reduced neural apoptosis induced by methylmalonate via targeting BCL2L11. Taken together, our results suggested that miR-9 might act as a monitor of changes in MMA and might provide new insights into a therapeutic entry point for treating MMA.

This study investigated whether miR-148a dysregulation differentiates poor prognosis of HCC, exploring new targets of miR-148a. miR-148a dysregulation discriminated not only the overall survival and recurrence free survival rates of HCC, but the microvascular invasion. In the human HCC samples, ubiquitin specific protease 4 (USP4) and sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1P1) were up-regulated as the new targets of miR-148a. USP4 and S1P1 were up-regulated in mesenchymal-type liver-tumor cells with miR-148a dysregulation, facilitating migration and proliferation of tumor cells. The inverse relationship between miR-148a and the identified targets was verified in a tumor xenograft model. In the analysis of human samples, the expression of USP4, but not S1P1, correlated with the decrease of miR-148a. In a heterotropic patient-derived HCC xenograft model, USP4 was also overexpressed in G1 and G2 tumors when miR-148a was dysregulated, reflecting the closer link between miR-148a and USP4 for a shift in the expansion phase of tumorgraft. In conclusion, miR-148a dysregulation affects the poor prognosis of HCC. Of the identified targets of miR-148a, USP4 overexpression may contribute to HCC progression towards more aggressive feature.

24799764	Title	MicroRNA profiling of activated and tolerogenic human dendritic cells.
24799764	Abstract	Dendritic cells (DCs) belong to the immune system and are particularly studied for their potential to direct either an activated or tolerogenic immune response. The roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in posttranscriptional gene expression regulation are being increasingly investigated. This study's aim is to evaluate the miRNAs' expression changes in prepared human immature (iDCs), activated (aDCs), and tolerogenic dendritic cells (tDCs). The dendritic cells were prepared using GM-CSF and IL-4 (iDC) and subsequently maturated by adding LPS and IFN-γ (aDC) or IL-10 and TGF-β (tDC). Surface markers, cytokine profiles, and miRNA profiles were evaluated in iDC, tDC, and aDC at 6 h and 24 h of maturation. We identified 4 miRNAs (miR-7, miR-9, miR-155 and miR-182), which were consistently overexpressed in aDC after 6 h and 24 h of maturation and 3 miRNAs (miR-17, miR-133b, and miR-203) and miR-23b cluster solely expressed in tDC. We found 5 miRNAs (miR-10a, miR-203, miR-210, miR-30a, and miR-449b) upregulated and 3 miRNAs downregulated (miR-134, miR-145, and miR-149) in both tDC and aDC. These results indicate that miRNAs are specifically modulated in human DC types. This work may contribute to identifying specific modulating miRNAs for aDC and tDC, which could in the future serve as therapeutic targets in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases.

24801601	Title	miR-17-5p promotes proliferation by targeting SOCS6 in gastric cancer cells.
24801601	Abstract	This study aimed to test the exact functions and potential mechanisms of miR-17-5p in gastric cancer. Using real-time PCR, miR-17-5p was found to be expressed more highly in gastric cancer compared with-normal tissues. Gain- and loss-of-function assays demonstrated that miR-17-5p increased the proliferation and growth of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Through reporter gene and western blot assays, SOCS6 was shown to be a direct target of miR-17-5p, and proliferative assays confirmed that SOCS6 exerted opposing function to that of miR-17-5p in gastric cancer. In short, miR-17-5p might function as a pro-proliferative factor by repressing SOCS6 in gastric cancer.

24801815	Title	Reduced MIR130A is involved in primary immune thrombocytopenia via targeting TGFB1 and IL18.
24801815	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a vital role in the regulation of immunological functions and prevention of autoimmune disease. The abnormal expressions of several miRNAs in patients with the acquired autoimmune disease, immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), have been reported. However, the exact mechanism of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of ITP is currently not well understood. This study examined the miRNA expression profile of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in ITP patients by miRNA array and TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction. MIR130A expression was found to be significantly decreased in PBMCs from patients with active chronic ITP compared with that of normal controls. Subsequently, dual-luciferase reporter gene analysis was used to validate that MIR130A targeted the transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFB1) and interleukin 18 (IL18) genes. In addition, we also monitored the dynamic expression of MIR130A and its targeted genes pre- and post-treatment of ITP patients and determined that the expression of MIR130A and TGFB1 was up-regulated, whereas IL18 expression was down-regulated after effective treatment. In conclusion, this study suggests that reduced MIR130A is involved in ITP via targeting of TGFB1 and IL18 expression.

24801999	Title	Transcriptional profiling reveals that C5a alters microRNA in brain endothelial cells.
24801999	Abstract	Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disturbance is a crucial occurrence in many neurological diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Our previous studies showed that experimental lupus serum altered the integrity of the mouse brain endothelial layer, an important constituent of the BBB. Complement activation occurs in lupus with increased circulating complement components. Using a genomics approach, we identified the microRNA (miRNA) altered in mouse brain endothelial cells (bEnd3) by lupus serum and the complement protein, C5a. Of the 318 miRNA evaluated, 23 miRNAs were altered by lupus serum and 32 were altered by C5a alone compared with controls. Seven miRNAs (P < 0 · 05) were differentially expressed by both treatments: mmu-miR-133a*, mmu-miR-193*, mmu-miR-26b, mmu-miR-28*, mmu-miR-320a, mmu-miR-423-3p and mmu-miR-509-5p. The microarray results were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. In line with the in vitro results, expression of miR-26b and miR-28* were also significantly up-regulated in lupus mouse brain which was reduced by C5a receptor inhibition. Target prediction analysis revealed miR gene targets encoding components involved in inflammation, matrix arrangement, and apoptosis, pathways known to play important roles in central nervous system lupus. Our findings suggest that the miRNAs reported in this study may represent novel therapeutic targets in central nervous system lupus and other similar neuroinflammatory settings.

24802407	Title	miR-214 promotes the proliferation and invasion of osteosarcoma cells through direct suppression of LZTS1.
24802407	Abstract	Previous studies have shown that miR-214 functions either as an oncogene or a tumor suppressor in various human cancer types. The role of this microRNA in osteosarcoma (OS) is presently unclear. Here, we demonstrated that miR-214 is frequently upregulated in OS specimens, compared with noncancerous bone tissues. Bioinformatics analysis further revealed leucine zipper, putative tumor suppressor 1 (LZTS1) as a potential target of miR-214. Expression patterns of miR-214 were inversely correlated with those of LZTS1 mRNA and protein in OS tissues. Data from reporter assays showed that miR-214 directly binds to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of LZTS1 mRNA and suppresses expression at both transcriptional and translational levels. In functional assays, miR-214 promoted OS cell proliferation, invasion and tumor growth in nude mice, which could be reversed by overexpression of LZTS1. Taken together, our data provide compelling evidence that miR-214 functions as an onco-miRNA in OS, and its oncogenic effects are mediated chiefly through downregulation of LZTS1.

24802408	Title	JMJD2A predicts prognosis and regulates cell growth in human gastric cancer.
24802408	Abstract	A number of JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases have been identified and biochemically characterized in mammalian. JMJD2A is a transcriptional cofactor and enzyme that catalyzes demethylation of histone H3 lysines 9 and 36. Here in this study, we aim to explore the role of JMJD2A in human gastric cancer. Quantitative real-time PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses reveal higher expression of JMJD2A in clinical gastric cancer tissues than that in normal gastric mucosa. JMJD2A expression is associated with tumor stage and nodal status, and high level of JMJD2A predicts poor overall and disease-free survival. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses demonstrate that JMJD2A could serve as an independent prognostic factor. Furthermore, we show that inhibition the expression of JMJD2A attenuates the growth and transformation of three lines of gastric cancer cells. Mechanically, JMJD2A knockdown induces apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by up-regulating the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and by down-regulating anti-apoptotic protein. Finally, we show that JMJD2A level is correlated with the level of the pro-apoptotic microRNA miR-34a in gastric cancer tissues and JMJD2A represses the expression of miR-34a by decreasing its promoter activity. Those findings demonstrate that JMJD2A regulates gastric cancer growth and serves as an independent prognostic factor, and implicate that JMJD2A may be a promising target for intervention.

24802670	Title	MiR-135b is a direct PAX6 target and specifies human neuroectoderm by inhibiting TGF-β/BMP signaling.
24802670	Abstract	Several transcription factors (TFs) have been implicated in neuroectoderm (NE) development, and recently, the TF PAX6 was shown to be critical for human NE specification. However, microRNA networks regulating human NE development have been poorly documented. We hypothesized that microRNAs activated by PAX6 should promote NE development. Using a genomics approach, we identified PAX6 binding sites and active enhancers genome-wide in an in vitro model of human NE development that was based on neural differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESC). PAX6 binding to active enhancers was found in the proximity of several microRNAs, including hsa-miR-135b. MiR-135b was activated during NE development, and ectopic expression of miR-135b in hESC promoted differentiation toward NE. MiR-135b promotes neural conversion by targeting components of the TGF-β and BMP signaling pathways, thereby inhibiting differentiation into alternate developmental lineages. Our results demonstrate a novel TF-miRNA module that is activated during human neuroectoderm development and promotes the irreversible fate specification of human pluripotent cells toward the neural lineage.

24803159	Title	Regulation of microcystin-LR-induced toxicity in mouse spermatogonia by miR-96.
24803159	Abstract	Microcystin (MC)-LR is a cyclic heptapeptide that acts as a potent reproductive system toxin, especially by decreasing sperm quality through affecting spermatogonia. However, the molecular mechanisms of MC-induced spermatogonial cytotoxicity still remain unclear. The present study was designed to investigate changes in microRNA (miRNA) profiles and their potential functions in spermatogonia (GC-1 cell line) following treatment with MC-LR. With microarray analysis, 101 miRNAs were identified to be significantly altered in GC-1 cells treated with MC-LR. Among the 25 miRNAs associated with spermatogenesis, miR-96 was down-regulated most dramatically and thus selected for further functional analysis. Deleted-in azoospermia-associated protein 2 (DAZAP2) was predicted to have a binding sequence for miR-96 within its 3'-untranslated region. Fluorescent reporter assay confirmed that DAZAP2 was the target gene of miR-96. The expression of DAZAP2 decreased significantly when miR-96 was up-regulated. Consistently, down-regulation of miR-96 significantly increased the level of DAZAP2. Up-regulation of miR-96 promoted cell viability in GC-1 cells as a result of exposure to MC-LR. Our study suggested a crucial role for miR-96 in the regulation of cytotoxic effects of MC-LR in spermatogonia, which provides new perspectives in the diagnosis and treatment strategies for MC-induced male infertility.

24803541	Title	EphB2 contributes to human naive B-cell activation and is regulated by miR-185.
24803541	Abstract	EphB2 is an important member of the receptor tyrosine kinases. Recently, EphB2 was shown to facilitate T-cell migration and monocyte activation. However, the effects of EphB2 on B cells remain unknown. In this study, the expression of EphB2 on B cells was tested by Western blot, and the roles of EphB2 in B-cell proliferation, cytokine secretion, and immunoglobulin (Ig) production were evaluated using EphB2 siRNA interference in human B cells from healthy volunteers. Our study revealed that EphB2 was distributed on naive B cells and was up-regulated on activated B cells. Moreover, B-cell proliferation (decreased by 22%, P<0.05), TNF-α secretion (decreased by 40%, P<0.01) and IgG production (decreased by 26%, P < 0.05) were depressed concordantly with the down-regulated EphB2 expression. Subsequently, we screened microRNAs that could regulate EphB2 expression in B cells, and discovered that miR-185 directly targeted to EphB2 mRNA and suppressed its expression. Furthermore, miR-185 overexpression inhibited B-cell activation, and the inhibitor of miR-185 enhanced B-cell activation. Moreover, abatement of EphB2 through miR-185 mimics or EphB2 siRNA attenuated the activation of Src-p65 and Notch1 signaling pathways in human B cells. Our study first suggested that EphB2 was involved in human naive B cell activation through Src-p65 and Notch1 signaling pathways and could be regulated by miR-185.

24805821	Title	Novel anti-apoptotic microRNAs 582-5p and 363 promote human glioblastoma stem cell survival via direct inhibition of caspase 3, caspase 9, and Bim.
24805821	Abstract	Glioblastoma is the most common and lethal primary brain tumor. Tumor initiation and recurrence are likely caused by a sub-population of glioblastoma stem cells, which may derive from mutated neural stem and precursor cells. Since CD133 is a stem cell marker for both normal brain and glioblastoma, and to better understand glioblastoma formation and recurrence, we looked for dys-regulated microRNAs in human CD133+ glioblastoma stem cells as opposed to CD133+ neural stem cells isolated from normal human brain. Using FACS sorting of low-passage cell samples followed by microRNA microarray analysis, we found 43 microRNAs that were dys-regulated in common in three separate CD133+ human glioblastomas compared to CD133+ normal neural stem cells. Among these were several microRNAs not previously associated with cancer. We then verified the microRNAs dys-regulated in glioblastoma using quantitative real time PCR and Taqman analysis of the original samples, as well as human GBM stem cell and established cell lines and many human specimens. We show that two candidate oncogenic microRNAs, miR-363 and miR-582-5p, can positively influence glioblastoma survival, as shown by forced expression of the microRNAs and their inhibitors followed by cell number assay, Caspase 3/7 assay, Annexin V apoptosis/fluorescence activated cell sorting, siRNA rescue of microRNA inhibitor treatment, as well as 3'UTR mutagenesis to show luciferase reporter rescue of the most successful targets. miR-582-5p and miR-363 are shown to directly target Caspase 3, Caspase 9, and Bim.

24807785	Title	MicroRNA-133 modulates the β1-adrenergic receptor transduction cascade.
24807785	Abstract	The sympathetic nervous system plays a fundamental role in the regulation of myocardial function. During chronic pressure overload, overactivation of the sympathetic nervous system induces the release of catecholamines, which activate β-adrenergic receptors in cardiomyocytes and lead to increased heart rate and cardiac contractility. However, chronic stimulation of β-adrenergic receptors leads to impaired cardiac function, and β-blockers are widely used as therapeutic agents for the treatment of cardiac disease. MicroRNA-133 (miR-133) is highly expressed in the myocardium and is involved in controlling cardiac function through regulation of messenger RNA translation/stability. To determine whether miR-133 affects β-adrenergic receptor signaling during progression to heart failure. Based on bioinformatic analysis, β1-adrenergic receptor (β1AR) and other components of the β1AR signal transduction cascade, including adenylate cyclase VI and the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A, were predicted as direct targets of miR-133 and subsequently validated by experimental studies. Consistently, cAMP accumulation and activation of downstream targets were repressed by miR-133 overexpression in both neonatal and adult cardiomyocytes following selective β1AR stimulation. Furthermore, gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies of miR-133 revealed its role in counteracting the deleterious apoptotic effects caused by chronic β1AR stimulation. This was confirmed in vivo using a novel cardiac-specific TetON-miR-133 inducible transgenic mouse model. When subjected to transaortic constriction, TetON-miR-133 inducible transgenic mice maintained cardiac performance and showed attenuated apoptosis and reduced fibrosis compared with control mice. miR-133 controls multiple components of the β1AR transduction cascade and is cardioprotective during heart failure.

24810113	Title	IGF-1R, a target of let-7b, mediates crosstalk between IRS-2/Akt and MAPK pathways to promote proliferation of oral squamous cell carcinoma.
24810113	Abstract	Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling is involved in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), but IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R)-mediated intricate regulatory networks among molecular interactions and signalling path ways in OSCC remain unclear. Here, we found that overexpression of IGF-1R and insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2) was negatively associated with histological differentiation. IGF signaling stimulated OSCC cell growth. Conversely, overexpression of let-7b inhibited proliferation and colony formation and triggered S/G2 cell cycle arrest by targeting IGF-1R and IRS-2 through the Akt pathway. Also, the inverse relationship between expression of let-7b and IGF-1R/IRS-2 was conﬁrmed in OSCC tumor xenografts and clinical specimens. Furthermore, by activating ERK1/2, IGF-1R transcriptionally upregulated IRS-2. Our results indicate that let-7b/IGF-1R-mediated crosstalk between IRS-2/Akt and MAPK is involved in OSCC and is a potential therapeutic target for therapy.

24810336	Title	miR-199a-3p displays tumor suppressor functions in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
24810336	Abstract	Thyroid cancer incidence is rapidly increasing. Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma (PTC), the most frequent hystotype, usually displays good prognosis, but no effective therapeutic options are available for the fraction of progressive PTC patients. BRAF and RET/PTC are the most frequent driving genetic lesions identified in PTC. We developed two complementary in vitro models based on RET/PTC1 oncogene, starting from the hypothesis that miRNAs modulated by a driving PTC-oncogene are likely to have a role in thyroid neoplastic processes. Through this strategy, we identified a panel of deregulated miRNAs. Among these we focused on miR-199a-3p and showed its under-expression in PTC specimens and cell lines. We demonstrated that miR-199a-3p restoration in PTC cells reduces MET and mTOR protein levels, impairs migration and proliferation and, more interesting, induces lethality through an unusual form of cell death similar to methuosis, caused by macropinocytosis dysregulation. Silencing MET or mTOR, both involved in survival pathways, does not recapitulate miR-199a-3p-induced cell lethality, thus suggesting that the cooperative regulation of multiple gene targets is necessary. Integrated analysis of miR-199a-3p targets unveils interesting networks including HGF and macropinocytosis pathways. Overall our results indicate miR-199a-3p as a tumor suppressor miRNA in PTC.

24810364	Title	Long noncoding RNA ANRIL indicates a poor prognosis of gastric cancer and promotes tumor growth by epigenetically silencing of miR-99a/miR-449a.
24810364	Abstract	Long noncoding RNAs are involved in diseases including cancer. Here, we reported that ANRIL (CDKN2B-AS1), a 3.8-kb long noncoding RNA, recruiting and binding to PRC2, was generally upregulated in human gastric cancer (GC) tissues. In a cohort of 120 GC patients, the higher expression of ANRIL was significantly correlated with a higher TNM stage (P=0.041) and tumor size (P=0.001). Multivariate analyses revealed that ANRIL expression served as an independent predictor for overall survival (P=0.036). Further experiments revealed that ANRIL knockdown significantly repressed the proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. We also showed that E2F1 could induce ANRIL and ANRIL-mediated growth promotion is in part due to epigenetic repression of miR-99a/miR-449a in Trans (controlling the targets--mTOR and CDK6/E2F1 pathway) by binding to PRC2, thus forming a positive feedback loop, continuing to promote GC cell proliferation. To our knowledge, this is the first report showed that the role of ANRIL in the progression of GC and ANRIL could crosstalk with microRNAs in epigenetic level. Our results suggest that ANRIL, as a growth regulator, may serve as a candidate prognostic biomarker and target for new therapies in human gastric cancer.

24810628	Title	miR-181c regulates the mitochondrial genome, bioenergetics, and propensity for heart failure in vivo.
24810628	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, which inhibit the stability and/or translation of a mRNA. miRNAs have been found to play a powerful role in various cardiovascular diseases. Recently, we have demonstrated that a microRNA (miR-181c) can be encoded in the nucleus, processed to the mature form in the cytosol, translocated into the mitochondria, and ultimately can regulate mitochondrial gene expression. However the in vivo impact of miR-181c is unknown. Here we report an in-vivo method for administration of miR-181c in rats, which leads to reduced exercise capacity and signs of heart failure, by targeting the 3'-end of mt-COX1 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1). We cloned miR-181c and packaged it in lipid-based nanoparticles for systemic delivery. The plasmid DNA complexed nanovector shows no apparent toxicity. We find that the mRNA levels of mitochondrial complex IV genes in the heart, but not any other mitochondrial genes, are significantly altered with miR-181c overexpression, suggesting selective mitochondrial complex IV remodeling due to miR-181c targeting mt-COX1. Isolated heart mitochondrial studies showed significantly altered O2-consumption, ROS production, matrix calcium, and mitochondrial membrane potential in miR-181c-treated animals. For the first time, this study shows that miRNA delivered to the heart in-vivo can lead to cardiac dysfunction by regulating mitochondrial genes.

24810858	Title	Overexpression of lncRNA H19 enhances carcinogenesis and metastasis of gastric cancer.
24810858	Abstract	Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play key roles in the progression and metastasis of some carcinomas. We previously showed that the expression of lncRNA H19 (H19) was higher in gastric cancer (GC) tissues than that in paired noncanerous tissues. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, H19/miR-675 knockdown models in the MKN45 cell line and ectopic expression models in the SGC7901 cell line were established, and a co-expression network of H19 was generated to identify target genes by RIP and DLR. The results showed that overexpression of H19 promoted the features of GC including proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis. An H19 co-expression network identified ISM1 as a binding protein of H19, and its expression was positively correlated with that of H19. CALN1 was identified as a target gene of miR-675 and its expression was negatively correlated with that of miR-675. H19 and MiR-675 function in a similar manner. However, H19 RNA actively binds to ISM1 and miR-675 targets CALN1. These differences suggest that H19 plays other roles besides encoding miR-675 in GC. Our results suggest that the effect of H19 in GC is mediated by the direct upregulation of ISM1 and the indirect suppression of CALN1 expression via miR-675.

24811402	Title	MiR-214 and N-ras regulatory loop suppresses rhabdomyosarcoma cell growth and xenograft tumorigenesis.
24811402	Abstract	Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a childhood malignant soft tissue cancer that is derived from myogenic progenitors trapped in a permanent mode of growth. Here, we report that miR-214 is markedly down-regulated in human RMS cell lines. Although not required for embryogenesis in mice, miR-214 suppresses mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) proliferation. When re-introduced into RD cells, a line of human embryonal RMS cells, miR-214 showed inhibition of tumor cell growth, induction of myogenic differentiation and apoptosis, as well as suppression of colony formation and xenograft tumorigenesis. We show that in the absence of miR-214, expression of proto-oncogene N-ras is markedly elevated in miR-214(-/-) MEFs, and manipulations of miR-214 levels using microRNA mimics or inhibitor in RD cells reciprocally altered N-ras expression. We further demonstrate that forced expression of N-ras from a cDNA that lacks its 3'-untranslated region neutralized the pro-myogenic and anti-proliferative activities of miR-214. Finally, we show that N-ras is a conserved target of miR-214 in its suppression of xenograft tumor growth, and N-ras expression is up-regulated in xenograft tumor models as well as actual human RMS tissue sections. Taken together, these data indicate that miR-214 is a bona fide suppressor of human RMS tumorigensis.

24813629	Title	MiR-152 reduces human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation and migration by targeting ADAM17.
24813629	Abstract	As a cleavage enzyme of precursor TNF-α, the high expression level of ADAM17 in endothelial cells is an important factor in atherosclerosis. In this study, we demonstrate that ADAM17 is the target of miR-152. We found that miR-152 could reduce TNF precursor cleavage and inhibit cell proliferation and migration by targeting ADAM17 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, the expression pattern of miR-152 and corresponding target ADAM17 was opposite in HUVECs under hypoxic conditions. The levels of circulating miR-152 in AS patient sera were lower than those detected in the sera of normal individuals. Our results indicate that miR-152 may be involved in the development of human atherosclerosis and could be used as diagnostic biomarker or therapeutic target in atherosclerosis.

24815696	Title	Huaier suppresses proliferation and induces apoptosis in human pulmonary cancer cells via upregulation of miR-26b-5p.
24815696	Abstract	Various studies have reported that Huaier possesses anti-tumor effects. However, the mechanisms are not completely elucidated. Here, we found 66 differentially expressed miRNAs in Huaier-treated pulmonary adenocarcinoma A549 cells, with upregulation of miR-26b-5p. Transfection of A549 cells with miR-26b-5p mimic inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis, while transfection of Huaier-treated A549 cells with a miR-26b-5p inhibitor reversed the effects of Huaier. EZH2 was verified as the target of miR-26b-5p. Thus, our findings indicate that Huaier might suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis in lung cancer cells via a miR-26b-5p-EZH2-mediated approach, which provides a new perspective for understanding the anti-tumor effects of Huaier.

24815849	Title	Tumor-suppressive microRNA-218 inhibits cancer cell migration and invasion via targeting of LASP1 in prostate cancer.
24815849	Abstract	Our recent studies of the microRNA (miRNA) expression signature in prostate cancer (PCa) indicated that miRNA-218 (miR-218) was significantly downregulated in clinical specimens, suggesting that miR-218 might act as a tumor-suppressive miRNA in PCa. The aim of the present study was to investigate the functional significance of miR-218 in PCa and to identify novel miR-218-regulated cancer pathways and target genes involved in PCa oncogenesis and metastasis. Restoration of miR-218 in PCa cell lines (PC3 and DU145) revealed that this miRNA significantly inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion. Gene expression data and in silico analysis demonstrated that LIM and SH3 protein 1 (LASP1) is a potential target of miR-218 regulation. LASP1 is a cytoskeletal scaffold protein that plays critical roles in cytoskeletal organization and cell migration. Luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-218 directly regulated expression of LASP1. Moreover, downregulating the LASP1 gene significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in cancer cells, and the expression of LASP1 was upregulated in cancer tissues. We conclude that loss of tumor-suppressive miR-218 enhanced cancer cell migration and invasion in PCa through direct regulation of LASP1. Our data on pathways regulated by tumor-suppressive miR-218 provide new insight into the potential mechanisms of PCa oncogenesis and metastasis.

24816316	Title	Increased miR-223 expression in T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis leads to decreased insulin-like growth factor-1-mediated interleukin-10 production.
24816316	Abstract	We hypothesized that the aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) T cells was involved in the pathogenesis of RA. The expression profile of 270 human miRNAs in T cells from the first five RA patients and five controls were analysed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Twelve miRNAs exhibited potentially aberrant expression in RA T cells compared to normal T cells. After validation with another 22 RA patients and 19 controls, miR-223 and miR-34b were over-expressed in RA T cells. The expression levels of miR-223 were correlated positively with the titre of rheumatoid factor (RF) in RA patients. Transfection of Jurkat cells with miR-223 mimic suppressed insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and transfection with miR-34b mimic suppressed cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) protein expression by Western blotting. The protein expression of IGF-1R but not CREB was decreased in RA T cells. The addition of recombinant IGF-1-stimulated interleukin (IL)-10 production by activated normal T cells, but not RA T cells. The transfection of miR-223 mimic impaired IGF-1-mediated IL-10 production in activated normal T cells. The expression levels of SCD5, targeted by miR-34b, were decreased in RA T cells after microarray analysis. In conclusion, both miR-223 and miR-34b were over-expressed in RA T cells, but only the miR-223 expression levels were correlated positively with RF titre in RA patients. Functionally, the increased miR-223 expression could impair the IGF-1-mediated IL-10 production in activated RA T cells in vivo, which might contribute to the imbalance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.

24821285	Title	microRNA-200c downregulates XIAP expression to suppress proliferation and promote apoptosis of triple-negative breast cancer cells.
24821285	Abstract	Despite advances in the understanding of breast cancer, patients most commonly have a poor prognosis, particularly those with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). microRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous non‑coding small RNAs, and their aberrant expression is linked to numerous malignancies. In the present study, the expression levels of miR‑200c in patients with TNBC were analyzed and it was identified that miR‑200c was downregulated in TNBC samples, compared with that in normal adjacent tissues. miR‑200c was overexpressed in the TNBC cell line MDA‑MB‑231 and its functions were studied in vitro and in vivo. An in vitro study revealed that the overexpression of miR‑200c inhibited MDA‑MB‑231 cell proliferation and resulted in the induction of apoptosis. The in vivo data indicated that the overexpression of miR‑200c significantly inhibited tumor growth and increased the rate of apoptosis. Target prediction revealed that the X‑linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) had putative complementary sequences to miR‑200c, which was confirmed by a dual luciferase reporter assay. Western blot analysis further demonstrated that the expression of XIAP was markedly reduced and that caspase‑3 was highly activated by the overexpression of miR‑200c. These findings suggested that miR‑200c may function as a tumor suppressor gene in TNBC, at least partly via directly targeting XIAP, and may therefore act as a potential therapeutic target in the development of novel treatment strategies for TNBC.

24821435	Title	miR-21 regulates N-methyl-N-nitro-N'-nitrosoguanidine-induced gastric tumorigenesis by targeting FASLG and BTG2.
24821435	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are recently discovered regulators of gene expression and are important in the regulation of many cellular events. Evidence collected to date shows that miRNAs are altered after exposure to environmental toxicants. However, the role that miR-21 plays in the gastric tumorigenesis induced by environmental carcinogens remains largely unknown. The aim of this study was to characterize the regulatory role of miR-21 in the carcinogenic processes following exposure to the N-nitroso carcinogen N-methyl-N-nitro-N'-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). We found a progressive dose- and time-dependent increase in miR-21 expression following treatment with MNNG. Dysregulated miR-21 affected both cell growth in GES-1 cells and the gastric tumorigenesis induced with MNNG. These data demonstrate the involvement of miR-21 in the malignant transformation and tumorigenesis activated by MNNG. We also established that the Fas ligand (FASLG) and B-cell translocation gene 2 (BTG2), regulated by miR-21, contribute to the transformation induced by MNNG in GES-1 cells. This is the first study to show that miR-21 is involved in chemical carcinogenesis in vivo and in vitro. The regulation by miR-21 of the gastric carcinogenesis induced by MNNG highlights the functional roles of miRNAs in chemical carcinogenesis, and offers a new explanation of the mechanisms underlying chemical carcinogenesis.

24823364	Title	Identification of miR-494 direct targets involved in senescence of human diploid fibroblasts.
24823364	Abstract	Cellular senescence is a permanent cell cycle arrest triggered by different stimuli. We recently identified up-regulation of microRNA (miR)-494 as a component of the genetic program leading to senescence of human diploid IMR90 fibroblasts. Here, we used 2-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) coupled to mass spectrometry to profile protein expression changes induced by adoptive overexpression of miR-494 in IMR90 cells. miR-494 induced robust perturbation of the IMR90 proteome by significantly (P≤0.05) down-regulating a number of proteins. Combination of mass spectrometry-based identification of down-regulated proteins and bioinformatic prediction of the miR-494 binding sites on the relevant mRNAs identified 26 potential targets of miR-494. Among them, computational analysis identified 7 potential evolution-conserved miR-494 targets. Functional miR-494 binding sites were confirmed in 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) of 4 of them [heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A3 (hnRNPA3), protein disulfide isomerase A3 (PDIA3), UV excision repair protein RAD23 homolog B (RAD23B), and synaptotagmin-binding cytoplasmic RNA-interacting protein (SYNCRIP)/heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein Q (hnRNPQ)]. Their reduced expression correlated with miR-494 up-regulation in senescent cells. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of hnRNPA3 and, to a lesser extent, RAD23B mirrored the senescent phenotype induced by miR-494 overexpression, blunting cell proliferation and causing up-regulation of SA-β-galactosidase and DNA damage. Ectopic expression of hnRNPA3 or RAD23B slowed the appearance of the senescent phenotype induced by miR-494. Overall, these findings identify novel miR-494 direct targets that are involved in cellular senescence.

24824429	Title	MicroRNA-27a modulates HCV infection in differentiated hepatocyte-like cells from adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells.
24824429	Abstract	Despite the discovery of hepatitis C virus (HCV) entry factor, the mechanism by which it is regulated by miRNAs remains unclear. Adipose tissue-derived human mesenchymal stem cells (AT-hMSCs) have been widely used for differentiated hepatocyte-like cells (DHCs). Here, we established an in vitro HCV infection model using DHCs from AT-hMSCs and identified miRNAs that modulate HCV infectivity. AT-hMSCs were differentiated into DHCs using the conditional media, and evaluated for hepatocyte characteristics using RT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, periodic acid-Schiff staining, and a urea synthesis assay. The expression of HCV candidate receptors was also verified using immunocytochemistry. The levels of candidate miRNAs targeting HCV receptors were then determined by relative quantitative RT-PCR (rqRT-PCR). Finally, DHCs were infected using HCVcc and serum from HCV-infected patients, and infectivity of the virus was measured by rqRT-PCR and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The expected changes in morphology, function and hepatic gene expression were observed during hepatic differentiation. Moreover, the expression of candidate HCV entry factors and miR-27a were altered during hepatic differentiation. The infection and replication of HCV occurred efficiently in DHCs treated with HCVcc or infected with serum from HCV-infected patients. In addition, HCV infectivity was suppressed in miR-27a-transfected DHCs, due to the inhibition of LDLR expression by miR-27a. Our results demonstrate that AT-hMSCs are a good source of DHCs, which are suitable for in vitro cultivation of HCV. Furthermore, these results suggest that miR-27a modulates HCV infectivity by regulating LDLR expression.

24828505	Title	Transactivation of micrornA-320 by microRNA-383 regulates granulosa cell functions by targeting E2F1 and SF-1 proteins.
24828505	Abstract	Our previous studies have shown that microRNA-320 (miR-320) is one of the most down-regulated microRNAs (miRNA) in mouse ovarian granulosa cells (GCs) after TGF-β1 treatment. However, the underlying mechanisms of miR-320 involved in GC function during follicular development remain unknown. In this study, we found that pregnant mare serum gonadotropin treatment resulted in the suppression of miR-320 expression in a time-dependent manner. miR-320 was mainly expressed in GCs and oocytes of mouse ovarian follicles in follicular development. Overexpression of miR-320 inhibited estradiol synthesis and proliferation of GCs through targeting E2F1 and SF-1. E2F1/SF-1 mediated miR-320-induced suppression of GC proliferation and of GC steroidogenesis. FSH down-regulated the expression of miR-320 and regulated the function of miR-320 in mouse GCs. miR-383 promoted the expression of miR-320 and enhanced miR-320-mediated suppression of GC proliferation. Injection of miR-320 into the ovaries of mice partially promoted the production of testosterone and progesterone but inhibited estradiol release in vivo. Moreover, the expression of miR-320 and miR-383 was up-regulated in the follicular fluid of polycystic ovarian syndrome patients, although the expression of E2F1 and SF-1 was down-regulated in GCs. These data demonstrated that miR-320 regulates the proliferation and steroid production by targeting E2F1 and SF-1 in the follicular development. Understanding the regulation of miRNA biogenesis and function in the follicular development will potentiate the usefulness of miRNA in the treatment of reproduction and some steroid-related disorders.

24830555	Title	MicroRNA-199a-5p affects porcine preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation.
24830555	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs, have emerged as novel and potent regulators of adipogenesis. However, few miRNAs have been fully investigated in porcine adipogenesis, given the fact that pig is not only an apropos model of human obesity research, but also a staple meat source of human diet. In this study, we showed that miRNA-199a-5p is highly expressed in porcine subcutaneous fat deposits compared to several other tissue types and organs measured alongside. Overexpression of miR-199a-5p in porcine preadipocytes significantly promoted cell proliferation while attenuating the lipid deposition in porcine adipocytes. By target gene prediction and experimental validation, we demonstrated that caveolin-1 (Cav-1) may be a bona fide target of miR-199a-5p in porcine adipocytes, accounting for some of miR-199a-5p's functions. Taken together, our data established a role of miR-199a-5p in porcine preadipocyte proliferation and differentiation, which is at least partially played by downregulating Cav-1.

24830600	Title	HDAC 1/4-mediated silencing of microRNA-200b promotes chemoresistance in human lung adenocarcinoma cells.
24830600	Abstract	Chemoresistance is one of the most significant obstacles in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) treatment, and this process involves genetic and epigenetic dysregulation of chemoresistance-related genes. Previously, we have shown that restoration of microRNA (miR)-200b significantly reverses chemoresistance of human LAD cells by targeting E2F3. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in the silencing of miR-200b are still unclear. Here we showed that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors could restore the expression of miR-200b and reverse chemoresistant phenotypes of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells. HDAC1/4 repression significantly increased miR-200b expression by upregulating histone-H3 acetylation level at the two miR-200b promoters partially via a Sp1-dependent pathway. Furthermore, silencing of HDAC1/4 suppressed cell proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis, induced G2/M cell cycle arrest and ultimately reversed in vitro and in vivo chemoresistance of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells, at least partially in a miR-200b-dependent manner. HDAC1/4 suppression-induced rescue of miR-200b contributed to downregulation of E2F3, survivin and Aurora-A, and upregulation of cleaved-caspase-3. HDAC1/4 levels in docetaxel-insensitive human LAD tissues, inversely correlated with miR-200b, were upregulated compared with docetaxel-sensitive tissues. Taken together, our findings suggest that the HDAC1/4/Sp1/miR-200b/E2F3 pathway is responsible for chemoresistance of docetaxel-resistant LAD cells.

24832599	Title	Axl-altered microRNAs regulate tumorigenicity and gefitinib resistance in lung cancer.
24832599	Abstract	The involvement of Axl kinase in non-small cell lung cancer's (NSCLC) acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib or erlotinib has been identified recently, but the mechanism by which Axl contributes to TKI resistance is largely unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) repress gene expression and their critical role in tumorigenesis has been implicated. To investigate the role of miRNAs in the Axl-mediated acquired gefitinib resistance, we examined the Axl-mediated miRNA changes in gefitinib-resistant lung cancers. A panel of Axl kinase-altered miRNAs was identified. In this study, we validate and report that miR-374a and miR-548b modulated by Axl have essential roles in cell cycle arrest, gefitinib-induced apoptosis, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, migration and tumorigenesis of gefitinib-resistant lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo by targeting Wnt5a and CCNB1 genes, respectively. Of clinical significance, high expression of Axl and miR-374a and low expression of miR-548b are associated with poor disease-free survival postoperatively. These findings indicate that the modulation of specific miRNAs may provide a therapeutic target to treat or reverse gefitinib resistance in NSCLC with high expression of Axl in the future.

24835395	Title	miR-27a regulates inflammatory response of macrophages by targeting IL-10.
24835395	Abstract	Although microRNAs were shown to participate in innate immune responses, it is not completely understood how they regulate negative immunomodulatory events. IL-10 is an important anti-inflammatory mediator that prevents excessive inflammation and associated immunological pathologies. Although the regulation of IL-10 expression has been well studied at both the transcriptional and translational levels, it is less clear how microRNAs control IL-10 expression during inflammation. In this study, we found that miR-27a is downregulated in macrophages following stimulation through TLR2 and TLR4, but not TLR3. Upregulation of miR-27a enhanced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in TLR2/4-activated macrophages. Conversely, knockdown of miR-27a diminished cytokine expression. Mechanistically, we found that miR-27a negatively regulates IL-10 expression; upregulation of miR-27a decreases, whereas downregulation of miR-27a increases, IL-10 expression in activated macrophages. Likely due to the decreased expression of IL-10, upregulation of miR-27a diminished IL-10-dependent STAT3 phosphorylation in TLR4-activated macrophages. Consistent with IL-10 being a potential mediator for the role of miR-27a in the immune response, blocking IL-10 abolished the enhancing effect of miR-27a on TLR4-activated inflammation. In conclusion, our study identified miR-27a downregulation as a negative-regulatory mechanism that prevents overly exuberant TLR2- and TLR4-driven inflammatory responses.

24837198	Title	MicroRNA-34A inhibits the growth, invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer by targeting PDGFR and MET expression.
24837198	Abstract	Within the family of RTKs (receptor tyrosine kinases), PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor) has been implicated in carcinogenesis and tumour development. miRNAs (microRNAs), which can target the mRNAs (messenger RNAs) of cancer-associated genes, are abnormally expressed in various cancers. In this study, our aim was to identify the miRNAs that target PDGFR-Alpha/Beta and to study the functions of these miRNAs. miR-34a was predicted to target PDGFR, and luciferase reporter assays showed that miR-34a could directly target PDGFR. Meanwhile, we found that miR-34a was down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and was associated with metastasis. Our findings showed that miR-34a could inhibit gastric cancer cell migration, invasion and proliferation, but these tumourigenic properties were only partially restored when PDGFR-Alpha/Beta was overexpressed. In subsequent experiments, we found that the overexpression of both PDGFR and MET could completely restore the gastric cancer tumourigenic properties. Moreover, the cancer-associated cell signalling pathway was studied, and we found that miR-34a could inhibit Akt [PKB (protein kinase B)] phosphorylation, which was restored by the overexpression of both PDGFR and MET. In conclusion, miR-34a may act as a potential tumour suppressor in gastric cancer and is associated with the mechanisms of gastric cancer metastasis; miR-34a can inhibit gastric cancer tumourigenesis by targeting PDGFR and MET through the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)/Akt pathway.

24839931	Title	Deregulation of miR-146a expression in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer affecting EGFR signaling.
24839931	Abstract	Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) plays important roles in the development and progression of pancreatic cancer (PC). Expression analysis of miR-146a in human PC tissues showed decreased expression in about 80% of samples compared to corresponding non-cancerous tissue. Moreover, expression of miR-146a in eight PC cell lines, and in pancreatic tissues obtained from transgenic mouse models of K-Ras (K), Pdx1-Cre (C), K-Ras;Pdx1-Cre (KC) and K-Ras;Pdx1-Cre;INK4a/Arf (KCI), showed down-regulation of miR-146a expression in KCI mice which was in part led to over-expression of its target gene, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Treatment of PC cells with CDF, a novel synthetic compound, led to re-expression of miR-146a, resulting in the down-regulation of EGFR expression. Moreover, re-expression of miR-146a by stable transfection or treatment with CDF in vivo (xenograft animal model) resulted in decreased tumor growth which was consistent with reduced EGFR, ERK1, ERK2, and K-Ras expression. Further knock-down of miR-146a in AsPC-1 cells led to the up-regulation of EGFR expression and showed increased clonogenic growth. In addition, knock-down of EGFR by EGFR siRNA transfection of parental AsPC-1 cells and AsPC-1 cells stably transfected with pre-miR-146a resulted in decreased invasive capacity, which was further confirmed by reduced luciferase activity in cells transfected with pMIR-Luc reporter vector containing miR-146a binding site. Collectively, these results suggest that the loss of expression of miR-146a is a fundamental mechanism for over-expression of EGFR signaling and that re-expression of miR-146a by CDF treatment could be useful in designing personalized strategy for the treatment of human PC.

24839982	Title	Targeting of multiple myeloma-related angiogenesis by miR-199a-5p mimics: in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor activity.
24839982	Abstract	Multiple myeloma (MM) cells induce relevant angiogenic effects within the human bone marrow milieu (huBMM) by the aberrant expression of angiogenic factors. Hypoxia triggers angiogenic events within the huBMM and the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is over-expressed by MM cells. Since synthetic miR-199a-5p mimics negatively regulates HIF-1α, we here investigated a miRNA-based therapeutic strategy against hypoxic MM cells. We indeed found that enforced expression of miR-199a-5p led to down-modulated expression of HIF-1α as well as of other pro-angiogenic factors such as VEGF-A, IL-8, and FGFb in hypoxic MM cells in vitro. Moreover, miR-199a-5p negatively affected MM cells migration, while it increased the adhesion of MM cells to bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, transfection of MM cells with miR-199a-5p significantly impaired also endothelial cells migration and down-regulated the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Finally, we identified a hypoxia\AKT/miR-199a-5p loop as a potential molecular mechanism responsible of miR-199a-5p down-regulation in hypoxic MM cells. Taken together our results indicate that miR-199a-5p has an important role for the pathogenesis of MM and support the hypothesis that targeting angiogenesis via a miRNA/HIF-1α pathway may represent a novel potential therapeutical approach for this still lethal disease.

24841200	Title	MicroRNA-200b suppresses arsenic-transformed cell migration by targeting protein kinase Cα and Wnt5b-protein kinase Cα positive feedback loop and inhibiting Rac1 activation.
24841200	Abstract	MicroRNA-200b (miR-200b) is a member of miR-200 family that has been found to inhibit cell migration and cancer metastasis; however, the underlying mechanism is not well understood. We previously reported that miR-200 expression is depleted in arsenic-transformed human bronchial epithelial cells with highly migratory and invasive characteristics, whereas stably re-expressing miR-200b strongly suppresses arsenic-transformed cell migration. This study was performed to investigate how miR-200b inhibits arsenic-transformed cell migration. We found that protein kinase Cα (PKCα) is significantly up-regulated in arsenic-transformed cells. Combining bioinformatics analysis with PKCα 3'-untranslated region vector luciferase reporter assays, we showed that PKCα is a direct target of miR-200b. Inhibiting PKCα activity or knocking down PKCα expression drastically reduced cell migration, phenocoping the inhibitory effect of overexpressing miR-200b. In contrast, forced expression of PKCα in miR-200b overexpressing cells impaired the inhibitory effect of miR-200b on cell migration. In addition, we also found a positive feedback loop between Wnt5b and PKCα in arsenic-transformed cells. Knocking down Wnt5b expression reduced phospho-PKC levels and cell migration; and knocking down PKCα expression decreased Wnt5b level and cell migration. Moreover, forced expression of PKCα increased Wnt5b and phospho-PKC levels and cell migration. Further mechanistic studies revealed that Rac1 is highly activated in arsenic-transformed cells and stably expressing miR-200b abolishes Rac1 activation changing actin cytoskeleton organization. Manipulating PKCα or Wnt5b expression levels significantly altered the level of active Rac1. Together, these findings indicate that miR-200b suppresses arsenic-transformed cell migration by targeting PKCα and Wnt5b-PKCα positive feedback loop and subsequently inhibiting Rac1 activation.

Rat bone marrow derived-MSCs were induced into neuron-like cells (MSC-NCs) by DMSO and BHA in vitro. The expression of neuron specific enolase (NSE), microtubule-associated protein tau (Tau), REST and its target genes, including synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) and L1 cell adhesion molecular (L1CAM), were detected in MSCs and MSC-NCs. miRNA array analysis was conducted to screen for the upregulated miRNAs after neuronal differentiation. TargetScan was used to predict the relationship between these miRNAs and REST gene, and dual luciferase reporter assay was applied to validate it. Gain and loss of function experiments were used to study the role of miR-29a upon neuronal differentiation of MSCs. The knockdown of REST was conducted to show that miR-29a affected this process through targeting REST. MSCs were induced into neuron-like cells which presented neuronal cell shape and expressed NSE and Tau. The expression of REST declined and the expression of SNAP25 and L1CAM increased upon the neuronal differentiation of MSCs. Among 14 upregulated miRNAs, miR-29a was validated to target REST gene. During the neuronal differentiation of MSCs, miR-29a inhibition blocked the downregulation of REST, as well as the upregulation of SNAP25, L1CAM, NSE and Tau. REST knockdown rescued the effect of miR-29a inhibition on the expression of NSE and Tau. Meanwhile, miR-29a knockin significantly decreased the expression of REST and increased the expression of SNAP25 and L1CMA in MSCs, but did not significantly affect the expression of NSE and Tau. miR-29a regulates neurogenic markers through targeting REST in mesenchymal stem cells, which provides advances in neuronal differentiation research and stem cell therapy for neurodegenerative diseases.

24842611	Title	MicroRNA-106b in cancer-associated fibroblasts from gastric cancer promotes cell migration and invasion by targeting PTEN.
24842611	Abstract	It is well established that the interaction between cancer cells and microenvironment has a critical role in tumor development, but the roles of miRNAs in this interaction are rarely known. Here, we have shown that miR-106b is up-regulated in cancer associated fibroblasts compared with normal fibroblasts established from patients with gastric cancer, the expression level of miR-106b is associated with poor prognosis of patients, and CAFs with down-regulated miR-106b could significantly inhibit gastric cancer cell migration and invasion by targeting PTEN. Taken together, these data suggest that miR-106b might be a novel candidate target for the treatment of gastric cancer.

24842756	Title	miR-20b suppresses Th17 differentiation and the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by targeting RORγt and STAT3.
24842756	Abstract	The differentiation and function of IL-17-producing Th17 cells are tightly regulated by specific transcription factors and cytokines, which are the key participants in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Although specific miRNAs have been shown to be involved in the development of MS and EAE, the potential role of miRNAs in the context of Th17-driven autoimmunity is just beginning to be clarified. miR-20b has been reported as a downregulated miRNA in blood cells of MS patients. In this report, it was further studied in greater detail because we found it was significantly downregulated during EAE, and, in the in vitro differentiation model, Th17 cells had lower expression of miR-20b than did Th1, Th2, or inducible T regulatory cells. Ectopic expression of miR-20b repressed Th17 differentiation in vitro. Using lentiviral vectors for miR-20b overexpression in vivo, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-20b led to decreased Th17 cells and reduced severity of EAE. Furthermore, we also identified both RAR-related orphan receptor γt and STAT3 as potential targets of miR-20b. Finally, we confirmed that the mild disease severity and low number of Th17 cells in LV-miR-20b-infected mice were largely reversed by coinfection of these mice with lentivirus-expressing RAR-related orphan receptor γt or STAT3 3'-untranslated regions. Taken together, our results contribute to the importance of miRNAs in Th17 differentiation and pathogenesis of MS and EAE.

24843176	Title	MicroRNA 28 controls cell proliferation and is down-regulated in B-cell lymphomas.
24843176	Abstract	Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), which originates from germinal center (GC) B cells and harbors translocations deregulating v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (MYC). A comparative analysis of microRNAs expressed in normal and malignant GC B cells identified microRNA 28 (miR-28) as significantly down-regulated in BL, as well as in other GC-derived B-NHL. We show that reexpression of miR-28 impairs cell proliferation and clonogenic properties of BL cells by modulating several targets including MAD2 mitotic arrest deficient-like 1, MAD2L1, a component of the spindle checkpoint whose down-regulation is essential in mediating miR-28-induced proliferation arrest, and BCL2-associated athanogene, BAG1, an activator of the ERK pathway. We identify the oncogene MYC as a negative regulator of miR-28 expression, suggesting that its deregulation by chromosomal translocation in BL leads to miR-28 suppression. In addition, we show that miR-28 can inhibit MYC-induced transformation by directly targeting genes up-regulated by MYC. Overall, our data suggest that miR-28 acts as a tumor suppressor in BL and that its repression by MYC contributes to B-cell lymphomagenesis.

24844433	Title	Induction of miR-29a by saturated fatty acids impairs insulin signaling and glucose uptake through translational repression of IRS-1 in myocytes.
24844433	Abstract	MicroRNAs have been shown to play an important role in insulin signaling but their biological function in insulin resistance induced by saturated fatty acids (SFA) remains largely unknown. Here, we report that SFA palmitate and high fat diet (HFD) significantly increase expression of miR-29a in myocytes. miR-29a targets IRS-1 3'UTR directly and represses IRS-1 expression at the translational level. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of miR-29a impairs insulin signaling and glucose uptake in myocytes through a substantial decrease in IRS-1. These findings suggest that the up-regulation of miR-29a by SFA is causally related to the development of insulin resistance in myocytes.

24845562	Title	The putative tumor suppressor microRNA-497 modulates gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion by repressing eIF4E.
24845562	Abstract	Accumulating evidence has shown that microRNAs are involved in multiple processes in gastric cancer (GC) development and progression. Aberrant expression of miR-497 has been frequently reported in cancer studies; however, the role and mechanism of its function in GC remains unknown. Here, we reported that miR-497 was frequently downregulated in GC tissues and associated with aggressive clinicopathological features of GC patients. Further in vitro observations showed that the enforced expression of miR-497 inhibited cell proliferation by blocking the G1/S transition and decreased the invasion of GC cells, implying that miR-497 functions as a tumor suppressor in the progression of GC. In vivo study indicated that restoration of miR-497 inhibited tumor growth and metastasis. Luciferase assays revealed that miR-497 inhibited eIF4E expression by targeting the binding sites in the 3'-untranslated region of eIF4E mRNA. qRT-PCR and Western blot assays verified that miR-497 reduced eIF4E expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. A reverse correlation between miR-497 and eIF4E expression was noted in GC tissues. Taken together, our results identify a crucial tumor suppressive role of miR-497 in the progression of GC and suggest that miR-497 might be an anticancer therapeutic target for GC patients.

24849932	Title	Epigenetic regulation of thyroid hormone receptor beta in renal cancer.
24849932	Abstract	Thyroid hormone receptor beta (THRB) gene is commonly deregulated in cancers and, as strengthened by animal models, postulated to play a tumor-suppressive role. Our previous studies revealed downregulation of THRB in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), but the culpable mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Since epigenetic regulation is a common mechanism influencing the expression of tumor suppressors, we hypothesized that downregulation of THRB in renal cancer results from epigenetic aberrances, including CpG methylation and microRNA-dependent silencing. Our study revealed that ccRCC tumors exhibited a 56% decrease in THRB and a 37% increase in DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) expression when compared with paired non-neoplastic control samples. However, THRB CpG methylation analysis performed using BSP, SNaPshot and MSP-PCR consistently revealed no changes in methylation patterns between matched tumor and control samples. In silico analysis resulted in identification of four microRNAs (miR-155, miR-425, miR-592, and miR-599) as potentially targeting THRB transcript. Luciferase assay showed direct binding of miR-155 and miR-425 to 3'UTR of THRB, and subsequent in vivo analyses revealed that transfection of UOK171 cell line with synthetic miR-155 or miR-425 resulted in decreased expression of endogenous TRHB by 22% and 64%, respectively. Finally, real-time PCR analysis showed significant upregulation of miR-155 (354%) and miR-425 (162%) in ccRCC when compared with matched controls. Moreover, microRNA levels were negatively correlated with the amount of THRB transcript in tissue samples. We conclude that CpG methylation is not the major mechanism contributing to decreased THRB expression in ccRCC. In contrast, THRB is targeted by microRNAs miR-155 and miR-425, whose increased expression may be responsible for downregulation of THRB in ccRCC tumors.

24854275	Title	MicroRNA-24 antagonism prevents renal ischemia reperfusion injury.
24854275	Abstract	Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury of the kidney is a major cause of AKI. MicroRNAs (miRs) are powerful regulators of various diseases. We investigated the role of apoptosis-associated miR-24 in renal I/R injury. miR-24 was upregulated in the kidney after I/R injury of mice and in patients after kidney transplantation. Cell-sorting experiments revealed a specific miR-24 enrichment in renal endothelial and tubular epithelial cells after I/R induction. In vitro, anoxia/hypoxia induced an enrichment of miR-24 in endothelial and tubular epithelial cells. Transient overexpression of miR-24 alone induced apoptosis and altered functional parameters in these cells, whereas silencing of miR-24 ameliorated apoptotic responses and rescued functional parameters in hypoxic conditions. miR-24 effects were mediated through regulation of H2A histone family, member X, and heme oxygenase 1, which were experimentally validated as direct miR-24 targets through luciferase reporter assays. In vitro, adenoviral overexpression of miR-24 targets lacking miR-24 binding sites along with miR-24 precursors rescued various functional parameters in endothelial and tubular epithelial cells. In vivo, silencing of miR-24 in mice before I/R injury resulted in a significant improvement in survival and kidney function, a reduction of apoptosis, improved histologic tubular epithelial injury, and less infiltration of inflammatory cells. miR-24 also regulated heme oxygenase 1 and H2A histone family, member X, in vivo. Overall, these results indicate miR-24 promotes renal ischemic injury by stimulating apoptosis in endothelial and tubular epithelial cell. Therefore, miR-24 inhibition may be a promising future therapeutic option in the treatment of patients with ischemic AKI.

24855559	Title	MicroRNA-206 suppresses gastric cancer cell growth and metastasis.
24855559	Abstract	Gastric cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death world-wide and carries a high rate of metastatic risk. In addition to other protein-coding oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, microRNAs play an important role in gastric cancer tumorigenic progression. Here, we show that miR-206 is expressed at markedly low levels in a cohort of gastric tumors compared to their matching normal tissues, and in a number of gastric cancer cell lines. Down-regulation of miR-206 was particularly significant in tumors with lymphatic metastasis, local invasion, and advanced TNM staging. We find that forced expression of miR-206 suppressed the proliferation, colony-formation, and xenograft tumorigenesis of SCG-7901 cells, a line of gastric cancer cells. Forced expression of miR-206 also suppressed SCG-7901 cell migration and invasion, as well as metastasis in cell culture or tail-vein injected mouse models, respectively. The anti-metastatic effect of miR-206 is likely mediated by targeting metastasis regulatory genes STC2, HDAC4, KLF4, IGF1R, FRS2, SFRP1, BCL2, BDNF, and K-ras, which were drastically down-regulated by stable expression of exogenous miR-206 in SCG-7901 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-206 is a tumor suppressor of gastric cancer acting at steps that regulate metastasis.

24855947	Title	An essential mesenchymal function for miR-143/145 in intestinal epithelial regeneration.
24855947	Abstract	Downregulation of the miR-143/145 microRNA (miRNA) cluster has been repeatedly reported in colon cancer and other epithelial tumors. In addition, overexpression of these miRNAs inhibits tumorigenesis, leading to broad consensus that they function as cell-autonomous epithelial tumor suppressors. We generated mice with deletion of miR-143/145 to investigate the functions of these miRNAs in intestinal physiology and disease in vivo. Although intestinal development proceeded normally in the absence of these miRNAs, epithelial regeneration after injury was dramatically impaired. Surprisingly, we found that miR-143/145 are expressed and function exclusively within the mesenchymal compartment of intestine. Defective epithelial regeneration in miR-143/145-deficient mice resulted from the dysfunction of smooth muscle and myofibroblasts and was associated with derepression of the miR-143 target Igfbp5, which impaired IGF signaling after epithelial injury. These results provide important insights into the regulation of epithelial wound healing and argue against a cell-autonomous tumor suppressor role for miR-143/145 in colon cancer.

24858688	Title	MicroRNA-497 inhibition of ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion through targeting of SMAD specific E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 1.
24858688	Abstract	Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecological malignancies worldwide. Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying ovarian cancer progression facilitates the development of promising strategy for ovarian cancer therapy. Previously, we observed frequent down-regulation of miR-497 expression in ovarian cancer tissues. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-497 in ovarian cancer metastasis. We found that endogenous miR-497 expression was down-regulated in the more aggressive ovarian cancer cell lines compared with the less aggressive cells. Exogenous expression of miR-497 suppressed ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion, whereas reduction of endogenous miR-497 expression induced tumor cell migration and invasion. Mechanistic investigations confirmed pro-metastatic factor SMURF1 as a direct target of miR-497 through which miR-497 ablated tumor cell migration and invasion. Further studies revealed that lower levels of miR-497 expression were associated with shorter overall survival as well as increased SMURF1 expression in ovarian cancer patients. Our results indicate that down-regulation of miR-497 in ovarian cancer may facilitate tumor metastasis. Restoration of miR-497 expression may be a promising strategy for ovarian cancer therapy.

24861464	Title	Inhibitors of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) activate tumor-suppressor microRNAs in human cancer cells.
24861464	Abstract	Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) enhances tumorigenesis and is commonly overexpressed in several types of cancer. To investigate the anticancer effects of EZH2 inhibitors, microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles were examined in gastric and liver cancer cells treated with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and 3-deazaneplanocin A (DZNep). We confirmed that SAHA and DZNep suppressed EZH2 expression in AGS and HepG2 cells and inhibited their proliferation. The results of microarray analyses demonstrated that miR-1246 was commonly upregulated in cancer cells by treatment with SAHA and DZNep. MiR-302a and miR-4448 were markedly upregulated by treatment with SAHA and DZNep, respectively. DYRK1A, CDK2, BMI-1 and Girdin, which are targets of miR-1246, miR-302a and miR-4448, were suppressed by treatment with SAHA and DZNep, leading to apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and reduced migration of AGS and HepG2 cells. ChIP assay revealed that SAHA and DZNep inhibited the binding of EZH2 to the promoter regions of miR-1246, miR-302a and miR-4448. These findings suggest that EZH2 inhibitors such as SAHA and DZNep exert multiple anticancer effects through activation of tumor-suppressor miRNAs.

24865424	Title	Lineage-specific splicing of a brain-enriched alternative exon promotes glioblastoma progression.
24865424	Abstract	Tissue-specific alternative splicing is critical for the emergence of tissue identity during development, yet the role of this process in malignant transformation is undefined. Tissue-specific splicing involves evolutionarily conserved, alternative exons that represent only a minority of the total alternative exons identified. Many of these conserved exons have functional features that influence signaling pathways to profound biological effect. Here, we determined that lineage-specific splicing of a brain-enriched cassette exon in the membrane-binding tumor suppressor annexin A7 (ANXA7) diminishes endosomal targeting of the EGFR oncoprotein, consequently enhancing EGFR signaling during brain tumor progression. ANXA7 exon splicing was mediated by the ribonucleoprotein PTBP1, which is normally repressed during neuronal development. PTBP1 was highly expressed in glioblastomas due to loss of a brain-enriched microRNA (miR-124) and to PTBP1 amplification. The alternative ANXA7 splicing trait was present in precursor cells, suggesting that glioblastoma cells inherit the trait from a potential tumor-initiating ancestor and that these cells exploit this trait through accumulation of mutations that enhance EGFR signaling. Our data illustrate that lineage-specific splicing of a tissue-regulated alternative exon in a constituent of an oncogenic pathway eliminates tumor suppressor functions and promotes glioblastoma progression. This paradigm may offer a general model as to how tissue-specific regulatory mechanisms can reprogram normal developmental processes into oncogenic ones.

24865442	Title	Differential expression of miRNAs in colon cancer between African and Caucasian Americans: implications for cancer racial health disparities.
24865442	Abstract	Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and mortality are higher in African Americans (AAs) than in Caucasian Americans (CAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to be dysregulated in colonic and other neoplasias. The aim of this exploratory study was to identify candidate miRNAs that could contribute to potential biological differences between AA and CA colon cancers. Total RNA was isolated from tumor and paired adjacent normal colon tissue from 30 AA and 31 CA colon cancer patients archived at Stony Brook University (SBU) and Washington University (WU)‑St. Louis Medical Center. miRNA profiles were determined by probing human genome-wide miRNA arrays with RNA isolated from each sample. Using repeated measures analysis of variance (RANOVA), miRNAs were selected that exhibited significant (p<0.05) interactions between race and tumor or significant (fold change >1.5, p<0.05) main effects of race and/or tumor. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) was used to confirm miRNAs identified by microarray analysis. Candidate miRNA targets were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. RANOVA results indicated that miR-182, miR152, miR-204, miR-222 and miR-202 exhibited significant race and tumor main effects. Of these miRNAs, q-PCR analysis confirmed that miR-182 was upregulated in AA vs. CA tumors and exhibited significant race:tumor interaction. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the levels of FOXO1 and FOXO3A, two potential miR-182 targets, are reduced in AA tumors. miRNAs may play a role in the differences between AA and CA colon cancer. Specifically, differences in miRNA expression levels of miR-182 may contribute to decreased survival in AA colon cancer patients.

24867582	Title	Regulation of retinal inflammation by rhythmic expression of MiR-146a in diabetic retina.
24867582	Abstract	Chronic inflammation and dysregulation of circadian rhythmicity are involved in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) can regulate inflammation and circadian clock machinery. We tested the hypothesis that altered daily rhythm of miR-146a expression in diabetes contributes to retinal inflammation. Nondiabetic and STZ-induced diabetic rats kept in 12/12 light/dark cycle were killed every 2 hours over a 72-hour period. Human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were synchronized with dexamethasone. Expression of miR-146a, IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), IL-1β, VEGF and ICAM-1, as well as clock genes was examined by real-time PCR and Western blot. To modulate expression levels of miR-146a, mimics and inhibitors were used. Diabetes inhibited amplitude of negative arm (per1) and enhanced amplitude of the positive arm (bmal1) of clock machinery in retina. In addition to clock genes, miR-146a and its target gene IRAK1 also exhibited daily oscillations in antiphase; however, these patterns were lost in diabetic retina. This loss of rhythmic pattern was associated with an increase in ICAM-1, IL-β, and VEGF expression. Human retinal endothelial cells had robust miR-146a expression that followed circadian oscillation pattern; however, HRECs isolated from diabetic donors had reduced miR-146a amplitude but increased amplitude of IRAK1 and ICAM-1. In HRECs, miR-146a mimic or inhibitor caused 1.6- and 1.7-fold decrease or 1.5- and 1.6-fold increase, respectively, in mRNA and protein expression levels of ICAM-1 after 48 hours. Diabetes-induced dysregulation of daily rhythms of miR-146a and inflammatory pathways under miR-146a control have potential implications for the development of diabetic retinopathy.

24870620	Title	MicroRNA-29c mediates initiation of gastric carcinogenesis by directly targeting ITGB1.
24870620	Abstract	Gastric cancer (GC) remains difficult to cure due to heterogeneity in a clinical challenge and the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease are complex and not completely understood. Accumulating evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in GC, but the role of specific miRNAs involved in this disease remains elusive. We performed next generation sequencing (NGS)-based whole-transcriptome profiling to discover GC-specific miRNAs, followed by functional validation of results. NGS-based miRNA profiles were generated in matched pairs of GCs and adjacent normal mucosa (NM). Quantitative RT-PCR validation of miR-29c expression was performed in 274 gastric tissues, which included two cohorts of matched GC and NM specimens. Functional validation of miR-29c and its gene targets was undertaken in cell lines, as well as K19-C2mE and K19-Wnt1/C2mE transgenic mice. NGS analysis revealed four GC-specific miRNAs. Among these, miR-29c expression was significantly decreased in GC versus NM tissues (p<0.001). Ectopic expression of miR-29c mimics in GC cell lines resulted in reduced proliferation, adhesion, invasion and migration. High miR-29c expression suppressed xenograft tumour growth in nude mice. Direct interaction between miR-29c and its newly discovered target, ITGB1, was identified in cell lines and transgenic mice. MiR-29c expression demonstrated a stepwise decrease in wild type hyperplasia-dysplasia cascade in transgenic mice models of GC. MiR-29c acts as a tumour suppressor in GC by directly targeting ITGB1. Loss of miR-29c expression is an early event in the initiation of gastric carcinogenesis and may serve as a diagnostic and therapeutic biomarker for patients with GC.

24873879	Title	Effect of microRNA-145 on IL-1β-induced cartilage degradation in human chondrocytes.
24873879	Abstract	MicroRNA-145 has been shown to regulate chondrocyte homeostasis. It seems that miR-145 is implicated in cartilage dysfunction in Osteoarthritis (OA). However, the functional role of miR-145 in interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β)-induced extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation of OA cartilage has never been clarified. Here, we show that miR-145 expression increased in OA chondrocytes and in response to IL-1β stimulation. We confirm that mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 (Smad3), a key factor in maintaining chondrocyte homeostasis, is directly regulated by miR-145. Modulation of miR-145 affects the expression of Smad3 causing a change of its downstream target gene expression as well as IL-1β-induced ECM degradation in OA chondrocytes. This indicates that miR-145 contributes to impaired ECM in OA cartilage probably in part via targeting Smad3.

24875127	Title	miR-1271 regulates cisplatin resistance of human gastric cancer cell lines by targeting IGF1R, IRS1, mTOR, and BCL2.
24875127	Abstract	Numerous studies showed that drug resistance of gastric cancer cells could be modulated by the abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) which target multiple cell signaling pathways. The possible function of miR-1271 in the formation of cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer cells has been investigated in this study. miR-1271 was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues and various gastric cancer cell lines. Moreover, it was down-regulated in the cisplatin-resistant gastric cancer cell line SGC7901/cisplatin (DDP) and the down-regulation of miR-1271 in SGC7901/DPP cells was accompanied by the up-regulation of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R)/insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) pathway-related proteins, i.e., IGF1R, IRS1, serine/threonine-protein kinase mTOR (mTOR), and the apoptosis regulator Bcl-2 (BCL2), compared with the parental SGC7901 cells. Over-expression of miR-1271 sensitized SGC7901/DDP cells to cisplatin. Changes in the luciferase activity of reporter constructs harboring the 3'-untranslated region of the above proteins in SGC7901/DDP cells suggested that IGF1R, IRS1, mTOR, and BCL2 were target genes of miR-1271. Enforced miR-1271 expression repressed the protein levels of its targets, inhibited proliferation of SGC7901/DDP cells, and sensitized SGC7901/DDP cells to DDP-induced apoptosis. Overall, on the basis of the results of our study, we proposed that miR-1271 could regulate cisplatin resistance in human gastric cancer cells, at least partially, via targeting the IGF1R/IRS1 pathway.

24875359	Title	MiR-124 protects human hepatic L02 cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis by targeting Rab38 gene.
24875359	Abstract	Hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) is an inevitable clinical problem for liver surgeons. Because microRNAs (miRNAs) participate in various hepatic pathophysiological processes, this study aimed to explore the role and potential mechanism of miR-124 in hepatic IRI. A liver IRI model was established in rats. The differential expression of miRNAs was detected using microarrays, and the expression of miR-124 was measured by qRT-PCR. A hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced oxidative stress apoptosis model was also established. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry, and viability was detected by CCK8. The expression of Rab38 was detected by Western blotting and qRT-PCR, and a luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the expression of the miR-124 target gene. The miRNA spectrum changes dramatically after hepatic IRI in rats, and miR-124 is significantly down-regulated after liver IRI. MiR-124 decreases the H2O2-induced apoptosis of human hepatic L02 cells by up-regulating the activation of the AKT pathway. Rab38 is a target gene of miR-124 and is involved in H2O2-induced apoptosis. Interference with the expression of the Rab38 gene can protect hepatic L02 from H2O2-induced apoptosis by increasing the phosphorylation of AKT. These protective effects of miR-124 are attenuated by over-expression of Rab38. Many miRNAs are involved in hepatic IRI in rats, and miR-124 is significantly decreased in this model. MiR-124 significantly decreases the H2O2-induced apoptosis of human hepatic L02 cells by targeting the Rab38 gene and activating the AKT pathway.

24876105	Title	miR-155 drives telomere fragility in human breast cancer by targeting TRF1.
24876105	Abstract	Telomeres consist of DNA tandem repeats that recruit the multiprotein complex shelterin to build a chromatin structure that protects chromosome ends. Although cancer formation is linked to alterations in telomere homeostasis, there is little understanding of how shelterin function is limited in cancer cells. Using a small-scale screening approach, we identified miR-155 as a key regulator in breast cancer cell expression of the shelterin component TERF1 (TRF1). miR-155 targeted a conserved sequence motif in the 3'UTR of TRF1, resulting in its translational repression. miR-155 was upregulated commonly in breast cancer specimens, as associated with reduced TRF1 protein expression, metastasis-free survival, and relapse-free survival in estrogen receptor-positive cases. Modulating miR-155 expression in cells altered TRF1 levels and TRF1 abundance at telomeres. Compromising TRF1 expression by elevating miR-155 increased telomere fragility and altered the structure of metaphase chromosomes. In contrast, reducing miR-155 levels improved telomere function and genomic stability. These results implied that miR-155 upregulation antagonizes telomere integrity in breast cancer cells, increasing genomic instability linked to poor clinical outcome in estrogen receptor-positive disease. Our work argued that miRNA-dependent regulation of shelterin function has a clinically significant impact on telomere function, suggesting the existence of "telo-miRNAs" that have an impact on cancer and aging.

24878960	Title	MicroRNA miR-124 controls the choice between neuronal and astrocyte differentiation by fine-tuning Ezh2 expression.
24878960	Abstract	Polycomb group protein Ezh2 is a histone H3 Lys-27 histone methyltransferase orchestrating an extensive epigenetic regulatory program. Several nervous system-specific genes are known to be repressed by Ezh2 in stem cells and derepressed during neuronal differentiation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation remain poorly understood. Here we show that Ezh2 levels are dampened during neuronal differentiation by brain-enriched microRNA miR-124. Expression of miR-124 in a neuroblastoma cells line was sufficient to up-regulate a significant fraction of nervous system-specific Ezh2 target genes. On the other hand, naturally elevated expression of miR-124 in embryonic carcinoma cells undergoing neuronal differentiation correlated with down-regulation of Ezh2 levels. Importantly, overexpression of Ezh2 mRNA with a 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) lacking a functional miR-124 binding site, but not with the wild-type Ezh2 3'-UTR, hampered neuronal and promoted astrocyte-specific differentiation in P19 and embryonic mouse neural stem cells. Overall, our results uncover a molecular mechanism that allows miR-124 to balance the choice between alternative differentiation possibilities through fine-tuning the expression of a critical epigenetic regulator.

24884732	Title	microRNA-182 targets special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 to promote colorectal cancer proliferation and metastasis.
24884732	Abstract	Increasing evidence has revealed that microRNAs (miRNA) played a pivotal role in regulating cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. The deregulation of miR-182 has been identified in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the role and mechanism of miR-182 in CRC have not been completely understood yet. The expression levels of miR-182 in CRC tissues and CRC cell lines were examined by performing stem-loop quantitative RT-PCR. The stable over-expression miR-182 cell lines and control cell lines were constructed by lentivirus infection. Subsequently, CCK-8 assay, plate colony formation assay, cell migration, invasion assay and experimental animal models were performed to detect the biological functions of miR-182 in vitro and in vivo. A luciferase reporter assay was conducted to confirm target associations. Western blot and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to examine the expression changes of molecular markers that are regulated by miR-182. We found that miR-182 expression is increased in CRC cells that originated from metastatic foci and human primary CRC tissues with lymph node metastases. The ectopic expression of miR-182 enhanced cell proliferation, invasion, and migration in vitro. Stable overexpression of miR-182 also facilitated tumor growth and metastasis in vivo too. Further research showed that miR-182 could directly target the 3'untranslated region (3'UTR) of SATB2 mRNA and subsequently repress both the mRNA and protein expressions of SATB2, which we identified in previous studies as a CRC metastasis-associated protein. Restoring SATB2 expression could reverse the effects of miR-182 on CRC cell proliferation and migration. Investigations of possible mechanisms underlying these behaviors induced by miR-182 revealed that miR-182 induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by modulating the expression of key cellular molecules in EMT. Our results illustrated that the up-regulation of miR-182 played a pivotal role in CRC tumorigenesis and metastasis, which suggesting a potential implication of miR-182 in the molecular therapy for CRC.

24885288	Title	Loss of miR-638 in vitro promotes cell invasion and a mesenchymal-like transition by influencing SOX2 expression in colorectal carcinoma cells.
24885288	Abstract	Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is a major cause of cancer mortality. The aberrant expression of several microRNAs is associated with CRC progression; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unclear. miR-638 and SRY-box 2 (SOX2) expression levels were detected in 36 tumor samples and their adjacent, non-tumor tissues from patients with CRC, as well as in 4 CRC cell lines, using real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR). SOX2 expression levels were detected in 90 tumor samples and their adjacent tissue using immunohistochemistry. Luciferase reporter and Western blot assays were used to validate SOX2 as a target gene of miR-638. The regulation of SOX2 expression by miR-638 was assessed using qRT-PCR and Western blot assays, and the effects of exogenous miR-638 and SOX2 on cell invasion and migration were evaluated in vitro using the HCT-116 and SW1116 CRC cell lines. We found that miR-638 expression was differentially impaired in CRC specimens and dependent on tumor grade. The inhibition of miR-638 by an antagomiR promoted cell invasion and a mesenchymal-like transition (lamellipodium stretching increased and cell-cell contacts decreased, which was accompanied by the suppression of the epithelial cell marker ZO-1/E-cadherin and the upregulation of the mesenchymal cell marker vimentin). A reporter assay revealed that miR-638 repressed the luciferase activity of a reporter gene coupled to the 3'-untranslated region of SOX2. miR-638 overexpression downregulated SOX2 expression, and miR-638 inhibition upregulated SOX2 expression. Moreover, miR-638 expression levels were correlated inversely with SOX2 mRNA levels in human CRC tissues. The RNAi-mediated knockdown of SOX2 phenocopied the invasion-inhibiting effect of miR-638; furthermore, SOX2 overexpression blocked the miR-638-induced CRC cell transition to epithelial-like cells. These results demonstrate that the loss of miR-638 promotes invasion and a mesenchymal-like transition by directly targeting SOX2 in vitro. These findings define miR-638 as a new, invasion-associated tumor suppressor of CRC.

24885472	Title	NF-κB-modulated miR-130a targets TNF-α in cervical cancer cells.
24885472	Abstract	Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) induces a variety of biological processes through transcriptional gene control whose products are components in various signaling pathways. MicroRNAs are a small endogenous non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are involved in tumorigenesis. Using human cervical cancer cell lines, this study aimed to investigate whether NF-κB could regulate miR-130a expression and the functions and targets of miR-130a. We used the HeLa and C33A cervical cancer cell lines that were transfected with NF-κB or miR-130a overexpression plasmids to evaluate their effects on cell growth. We utilized bioinformatics, a fluorescent reporter assay, qRT-PCR and Western blotting to identify downstream target genes. In HeLa and C33A cells, NF-κB and miR-130a overexpression promoted cell growth, but genetic knockdowns suppressed growth. TNF-α was identified as a target of miR-130a by binding in a 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) EGFP reporter assay and by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, low TNF-α concentrations stimulated NF-κB activity and then induced miR-130a expression, and TNF-α overexpression rescued the effects of miR-130a on cervical cancer cells. Our findings indicate that TNF-α can activate NF-κB activity, which can reduce miR-130a expression, and that miR-130a targets and downregulates TNF-α expression. Hence, we shed light on the negative feedback regulation of NF-κB/miR-130a/TNF-α/NF-κB in cervical cancer and may provide insight into the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer.

24885626	Title	miR-300 inhibits epithelial to mesenchymal transition and metastasis by targeting Twist in human epithelial cancer.
24885626	Abstract	Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key step of the progression of tumor cell metastasis. Recent work has demonstrated some miRNAs play critical roles in EMT. In this study, we focused on the roles of miR-300 in regulating EMT. The expression levels of miR-300 were examined in epithelial carcinoma cells that underwent an EMT using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. The role of miR-300 in EMT was investigated by transfection of the miR-300 mimic or inhibitor in natural epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype cell line pairs and in transforming growth factor (TGF) beta-induced EMT cell models. A luciferase reporter assay and a rescue experiment were conducted to confirm the target gene of miR-300. The efficacy of miR-300 against tumor invasion and metastasis was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. Correlation analysis between miR-300 expression and the expression levels of its target gene, as well as tumor metastasis was performed in specimens from patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). MiR-300 was found down-regulated in the HNSCC cells and breast cancer cells that underwent EMT. Ectopic expression of miR-300 effectively blocked TGF-beta-induced EMT and reversed the phenotype of EMT in HN-12 and MDA-MB-231 cells, but inhibition of miR-300 in the epithelial phenotype cells, HN-4 and MCF-7 cells, could induce EMT. The luciferase reporter assay and the rescue assay results showed that miR-300 directly targets the 3'UTR of Twist. Enforced miR-300 expression suppressed cell invasion in vitro and experimental metastasis in vivo. Clinically, miR-300 expression was found inversely correlated with Twist expression and reduced miR-300 was associated with metastasis in patient specimens. Down-regulation of miR-300 is required for EMT initiation and maintenance. MiR-300 may negatively regulate EMT by direct targeting Twist and therefore inhibit cancer cell invasion and metastasis, which implicates miR-300 as an attractive candidate for cancer therapy.

24885920	Title	microRNA-139-5p exerts tumor suppressor function by targeting NOTCH1 in colorectal cancer.
24885920	Abstract	miR-139-5p was identified to be significantly down-regulated in colon tumor tissues by miRNA array. We aimed to clarify its biological function, molecular mechanisms and direct target gene in colorectal cancer (CRC). The biological function of miR-139-5p was examined by cell growth, cell cycle and apoptosis analysis in vitro and in vivo. miR-139-5p target gene and signaling pathway was identified by luciferase activity assay and western blot. miR-139-5p was significantly down-regulated in primary tumor tissues (P < 0.0001). Ectopic expression of miR-139-5p in colon cancer cell lines significantly suppressed cell growth as evidenced by cell viability assay (P < 0.001) and colony formation assay (P < 0.01) and in xenograft tumor growth in nude mice (P < 0.01). miR-139-5p induced apoptosis (P < 0.01), concomitantly with up-regulation of key apoptosis genes including cleaved caspase-8, caspase-3, caspase-7 and PARP. miR-139-5p also caused cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase (P < 0.01), with upregulation of key G0/G1 phase regulators p21Cip1/Waf1 and p27Kip1. Moreover, miR-139-5p inhibited cellular migration (P < 0.001) and invasiveness (P < 0.001) through the inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)7 and MMP9. Oncogene NOTCH1 was revealed to be a putative target of miR-139-5p, which was inversely correlated with miR-139-5p expression (r = -0.3862, P = 0.0002). miR-139-5p plays a pivotal role in colon cancer through inhibiting cell proliferation, metastasis, and promoting apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by targeting oncogenic NOTCH1.

24886316	Title	Tumor suppressor miR-24 restrains gastric cancer progression by downregulating RegIV.
24886316	Abstract	microRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that modulate a variety of cellular processes by regulating multiple targets, which can promote or inhibit the development of malignant behaviors. Accumulating evidence suggests miR-24 plays important roles in human carcinogenesis. However, its precise biological role remains largely elusive. This study examined the role of miR-24 in gastric cancer (GC). The expression of miR-24 in GC tissues compared with matched non-tumor tissues and GC cells was detected by qRT-PCR. Synthetic short single or double stranded RNA oligonucleotides and lentiviral vectors were used to regulate miR-24 expression in GC cells to investigate its function in vitro and in vivo. miR-24 was significantly downregulated in GC tissues compared with matched non-tumor tissues and was associated with tumor differentiation. Ectopic expression of miR-24 in SGC-7901 GC cells suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro as well as tumorigenicity in vivo by inducing cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and promoting cell apoptosis. Furthermore, we identified RegIV as a target of miR-24 and demonstrated that miR-24 regulated RegIV expression via binding its 3' untranslated region. miR-24 functions as a novel tumor suppressor in GC and the anti-oncogenic activity may involve its inhibition of the target gene RegIV. These findings suggest the possibility for miR-24 as a therapeutic target in GC.

24886554	Title	Downregulation of microRNA-182-5p contributes to renal cell carcinoma proliferation via activating the AKT/FOXO3a signaling pathway.
24886554	Abstract	Emerging evidence has suggested that dysregulation of miR-182-5p may contribute to tumor development and progression in several types of human cancers. However, its role in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is still unknown. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to quantify miR-182-5p expression in RCC clinical tissues. Bisulfite sequencing PCR was used for DNA methylation analysis. The CCK-8, colony formation, flow cytometry, and a xenograft model were performed. Immunohistochemistry was conducted using the peroxidase and DAB methods. A miR-182-5p target was determined by luciferase reporter assays, quantitative RT-PCR, and Western blotting. miR-182-5p is frequently down-regulated in human RCC tissues. Epigenetic modulation may be involved in the regulation of miR-182-5p expression. Enforced expression of miR-182-5p in RCC cells significantly inhibited the proliferation and tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, overexpression of miR-182-5p induced G1-phase arrest via inhibition of AKT/FOXO3a signaling. Moreover, FLOT1 was confirmed as a target of miR-182-5p. Silencing FLOT1 by small interfering RNAs phenocopied the effects of miR-182-5p overexpression, whereas restoration of FLOT1 in miR-182-5p -overexpressed RCC cells partly reversed the suppressive effects of miR-182-5p. These findings highlight an important role for miR-182-5p in the pathogenesis of RCC, and restoration of miR-182-5p could be considered as a potential therapeutic strategy for RCC therapy.

24886719	Title	Argonaute 2 promotes myeloma angiogenesis via microRNA dysregulation.
24886719	Abstract	Dysregulated microRNA (miRNA) expression contributes to cancer cell proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is a hallmark of multiple myeloma (MM) development and progression. Argonaute 2 (AGO2) protein, a core component of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), can directly bind to miRNAs and mediate target messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation. A previous study showed that AGO2 knockdown suppressed human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) growth and tube formation. However, the roles and molecular mechanisms of AGO2-induced myeloma angiogenesis are not yet fully understood. The aim of this study was to characterize these roles and effects and their associated mechanisms. Supernatants from AGO2-overexpressing MM lines induced HUVEC migration and accelerated tube formation. Conversely, supernatants from AGO2-knockdown MM lines suppressed HUVEC cell migration and tube formation. Moreover, a chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay was used to demonstrate that AGO2 could drive neovessel formation in MM lines in vivo. Using an miRNA microarray, we observed that 25 miRNAs were upregulated and 7 were downregulated in response to AGO2. Most let-7 family members and 2 miR-17/92 cluster members (miR-17a and miR-92-1), all known pro-angiogenic miRNAs, were positively regulated by AGO2 whereas anti-angiogenic miRNAs such as miR-145 and miR-361 were negatively regulated by AGO2. We conclude that AGO2 can drive neovessel formation in vitro and in vivo by dysregulating the expression of some angiogenic miRNAs. The pro-angiogenic miRNAs of the let-7 family and the miR-17/92 cluster, along with the anti-angiogenic miRNA miR-145, play crucial roles in AGO2-mediated angiogenesis by targeting angiogenesis-related genes.

24887517	Title	miR-21 overexpression enhances TGF-β1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition by target smad7 and aggravates renal damage in diabetic nephropathy.
24887517	Abstract	Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) with diabetic nephropathy (DN). Smad7 (a inhibitory smad), a downstream signaling molecules of TGF-β1, represses the EMT. The physiological function of miR-21 is closely linked to EMT and RIF. However, it remained unclear whether miR-21 over-expression affected TGF-β1-induced EMT by regulating smad7 in DN. In this study, real-time RT-PCR, cell transfection, luciferase reporter gene assays, western blot and confocal microscope were used, respectively. Here, we found that miR-21 expression was upregulated by TGF-β1 in time- and concentration -dependent manner. Moreover, miR-21 over-expression enhanced TGF-β1-induced EMT(upregulation of a-SMA and downregulation of E-cadherin) by directly down-regulating smad7/p-smad7 and indirectly up-regulating smad3/p-smad3, accompanied by the decrease of Ccr and the increase of col-IV, FN, the content of collagen fibers, RTBM, RTIAW and ACR. Meantime, the siRNA experiment showed that smad7 can directly regulate a-SMA and E-cadherin expression. More importantly, miR-21 inhibitor can not only inhibit EMT and fibrosis but also ameliorate renal structure and function. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that miR-21 overexpression can contribute to TGF-β1-induced EMT by inhibiting target smad7, and that targeting miR-21 may be a better alternative to directly suppress TGF-β1-mediated fibrosis in DN.

24890815	Title	MicroRNA-26b inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting USP9X.
24890815	Abstract	Metastasis is responsible for the rapid recurrence and poor survival of malignancies. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has a critical role in metastasis. Increasing evidence indicates that EMT can be regulated by microRNAs (miRNAs). The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-26b in modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as to identify its underlying mechanism of action. The expression level of miR-26b was assessed in multiple HCC cell lines (HepG2, MHCC97H, Hep3B, MHCC97L, HCCC9810, BEL-7402, Huh7 and QGY-7703), as well as in liver tissue from patients with HCC. Follow-up studies examined the effects of a miR-26b mimic (increased expression) and a miR-26b inhibitor (decreased expression) on markers of EMT, wound healing and cell migration. The molecular target of miR-26b was also identified using a computer algorithm and confirmed experimentally. MiR-26b expression was decreased in HCC cell lines and was inversely correlated with the grade of HCC. Increased expression of miR-26b inhibited the migration and invasiveness of HCC cell lines, which was accompanied by decreased expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and increased expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin, at both the mRNA and protein expression levels. A binding site for miR-26b was theoretically identified in the 3'UTR of USP9X. Further studies revealed that overexpression of miR-26b repressed the endogenous level of USP9X protein expression. Overexpression of miR-26b also repressed Smad4 expression, whereas its inhibition elevated Smad4 expression. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-26b were inhibited in HCC. In HCC cell lines, miR-26b targeted the 3'UTR of USP9X, which in turn affects EMT through Smad4 and the TGF-β signaling pathway. Our analysis of clinical HCC samples verifies that miR-26b also targets USP9X expression to inhibit the EMT of hepatocytes. Thus, miR-26b may have some effects on the EMT of HCC cells.

24891504	Title	Involvement of microRNAs in the regulation of muscle wasting during catabolic conditions.
24891504	Abstract	Loss of muscle proteins and the consequent weakness has important clinical consequences in diseases such as cancer, diabetes, chronic heart failure, and in aging. In fact, excessive proteolysis causes cachexia, accelerates disease progression, and worsens life expectancy. Muscle atrophy involves a common pattern of transcriptional changes in a small subset of genes named atrophy-related genes or atrogenes. Whether microRNAs play a role in the atrophy program and muscle loss is debated. To understand the involvement of miRNAs in atrophy we performed miRNA expression profiling of mouse muscles under wasting conditions such as fasting, denervation, diabetes, and cancer cachexia. We found that the miRNA signature is peculiar of each catabolic condition. We then focused on denervation and we revealed that changes in transcripts and microRNAs expression did not occur simultaneously but were shifted. Indeed, whereas transcriptional control of the atrophy-related genes peaks at 3 days, changes of miRNA expression maximized at 7 days after denervation. Among the different miRNAs, microRNA-206 and -21 were the most induced in denervated muscles. We characterized their pattern of expression and defined their role in muscle homeostasis. Indeed, in vivo gain and loss of function experiments revealed that miRNA-206 and miRNA-21 were sufficient and required for atrophy program. In silico and in vivo approaches identified transcription factor YY1 and the translational initiator factor eIF4E3 as downstream targets of these miRNAs. Thus miRNAs are important for fine-tuning the atrophy program and their modulation can be a novel potential therapeutic approach to counteract muscle loss and weakness in catabolic conditions.

24892549	Title	Functional screening identifies miRNAs influencing apoptosis and proliferation in colorectal cancer.
24892549	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a critical role in many biological processes and are aberrantly expressed in human cancers. Particular miRNAs function either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes and appear to have diagnostic and prognostic significance. Although numerous miRNAs are dys-regulated in colorectal cancer (CRC) only a small fraction has been characterized functionally. Using high-throughput functional screening and miRNA profiling of clinical samples the present study aims at identifying miRNAs important for the control of cellular growth and/or apoptosis in CRC. The high-throughput functional screening was carried out in six CRC cell lines transfected with a pre-miR library including 319 synthetic human pre-miRs. Phenotypic alterations were evaluated by immunostaining of cleaved cPARP (apoptosis) or MKI67 (proliferation). Additionally, TaqMan Human MicroRNA Array Set v2.0 was used to profile the expression of 667 miRNAs in 14 normal colon mucosa and 46 microsatellite stable stage II CRC patients. Among the miRNAs that induced growth arrest and apoptosis in the CRC cell lines, and at same time were dys-regulated in the clinical samples, miR-375 was selected for further analysis. Independent in vitro analysis of transient and stable transfected CRC cell lines confirmed that miR-375 reduces cell viability through the induction of apoptotic death. We identified YAP1 as a direct miR-375 target in CRC and show that HELLS and NOLC1 are down-stream targets. Knock-down of YAP1 mimicked the phenotype induced by miR-375 over-expression indicating that miR-375 most likely exerts its pro-apoptotic role through YAP1 and its anti-apoptotic down-stream targets BIRC5 and BCL2L1. Finally, in vivo analysis of mouse xenograft tumors showed that miR-375 expression significantly reduced tumor growth. We conclude that the high-throughput screening successfully identified miRNAs that induce apoptosis and/or inhibit proliferation in CRC cells. Finally, combining the functional screening with profiling of CRC tissue samples we identified clinically relevant miRNAs and miRNA targets in CRC.

24892674	Title	Down-regulation of mir-221 and mir-222 restrain prostate cancer cell proliferation and migration that is partly mediated by activation of SIRT1.
24892674	Abstract	Studies have shown that miR-221 and miR-222 are deregulated in many cancers, including prostate cancer. Nevertheless, the biological role and the underlying mechanisms of miR-221 and miR-222 in the pathogenesis of androgen-independent prostate cancer are still not clear. The proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle distinction, and migration capacity of prostate cells were determined following transfection of miR-221 or miR-222 inhibitor. The biological impact and regulation of SIRT1 on prostate cancer cells were investigated. MiR-221 and miR-222 were highly expressed in PC-3 cells compared with in LNCap cells. After miR-221 or miR-222 expression was inhibited, the proliferation and migration rates of PC-3 cells decreased and the apoptosis rate increased. Moreover, SIRT1 protein was up-regulated in cells after they were transfected with miR-221 or miR-222 inhibitor. Cells transfected with siSIRT1 showed increased migration and a decreased apoptosis rate, but there was no significant effect on cell proliferation compared with the controls. There was a negative correlation between miR-221 or miR-222 and SIRT1, but no direct target relationship was identified. These data demonstrate that miR-221 and miR-222 are highly expressed in PC-3 cells. Their inhibition leads to reduced cell proliferation and migration and increased apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. These effects are potentially mediated by up-regulation of SIRT1.

24892945	Title	MicroRNA-146a regulates human foetal femur derived skeletal stem cell differentiation by down-regulating SMAD2 and SMAD3.
24892945	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRs) play a pivotal role in a variety of biological processes including stem cell differentiation and function. Human foetal femur derived skeletal stem cells (SSCs) display enhanced proliferation and multipotential capacity indicating excellent potential as candidates for tissue engineering applications. This study has examined the expression and role of miRs in human foetal femur derived SSC differentiation along chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages. Cells isolated from the epiphyseal region of the foetal femur expressed higher levels of genes associated with chondrogenesis while cells from the foetal femur diaphyseal region expressed higher levels of genes associated with osteogenic differentiation. In addition to the difference in osteogenic and chondrogenic gene expression, epiphyseal and diaphyseal cells displayed distinct miRs expression profiles. miR-146a was found to be expressed by human foetal femur diaphyseal cells at a significantly enhanced level compared to epiphyseal populations and was predicted to target various components of the TGF-β pathway. Examination of miR-146a function in foetal femur cells confirmed regulation of protein translation of SMAD2 and SMAD3, important TGF-β and activin ligands signal transducers following transient overexpression in epiphyseal cells. The down-regulation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 following overexpression of miR-146a resulted in an up-regulation of the osteogenesis related gene RUNX2 and down-regulation of the chondrogenesis related gene SOX9. The current findings indicate miR-146a plays an important role in skeletogenesis through attenuation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 function and provide further insight into the role of miRs in human skeletal stem cell differentiation modulation with implications therein for bone reparation.

24897960	Title	Evaluation of microRNA-10b prognostic significance in a prospective cohort of breast cancer patients.
24897960	Abstract	MicroRNA-10b (miR-10b) has a prominent role in regulating tumor invasion and metastasis by targeting the HOXD10 transcriptional repressor and has been found up-regulated in several tumor types. We evaluated the expression of miR-10b in paired tumor and normal specimens obtained from a prospective cohort of breast cancer patients with at least 36 months follow-up enrolled according to the REMARK guidelines (n = 150). RNA quality was measured and only samples with RNA Integrity Number (RIN) ≥7.0 were analyzed. The relative expression of miR-10b in tumor as compared to its normal counterpart (RER) was determined by RT-qPCR. miR-10b RERs were higher in the subgroup of patients with synchronous metastases (n = 11, Median 0.25; IQR 0.11-1.02) as compared with patients without metastases (n = 90, Median 0.09; IQR 0.04-0.29) (p = 0.028). In the subgroup of patients without synchronous metastases (n = 90), higher miR-10b RERs were associated with increased risk of disease progression and death in both univariable (HR 1.16, p = 0.021 and HR 1.20, p = 0.015 respectively for 0.10 unitary increase of miR-10b RERs levels) and multivariable (HR1.30, p < 0.001, and HR 1.31, p = 0.003 respectively for 0.10 unitary increase of miR-10b RERs levels) Cox regression models. The addition of miR-10b RERs to the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) provided an improvement in discrimination power and risk reclassification abilities for the clinical outcomes at 36 months. Survival C-indices significantly increased from 0.849 to 0.889 (p = 0.009) for OS and from 0.735 to 0.767 (p = 0.050) for DFS. Our results provide evidences that the addition of miR-10b RERs to the prognostic factors used in clinical routine could improve the prediction abilities for both overall mortality and disease progression in breast cancer patients.

24898268	Title	3,3'-diindolylmethane ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by promoting cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in activated T cells through microRNA signaling pathways.
24898268	Abstract	3,3'-Diindolylmethane (DIM) is a naturally derived indole found in cruciferous vegetables that has great potential as a novel and effective therapeutic agent. In the current study, we investigated the effects of DIM post-treatment on the regulation of activated T cells during the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model of multiple sclerosis. We demonstrated that the administration of DIM 10 days after EAE induction was effective at ameliorating disease parameters, including inflammation and central nervous system cellular infiltration. MicroRNA (miRNA) microarray analysis revealed an altered miRNA profile in brain infiltrating CD4(+) T cells following DIM post-treatment of EAE mice. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis suggested the involvement of DIM-induced miRNAs in pathways and processes that halt cell cycle progression and promote apoptosis. Additional studies confirmed that DIM impacted these cellular processes in activated T cells. Further evidence indicated that DIM treatment significantly upregulated several miRNAs (miR-200c, miR-146a, miR-16, miR-93, and miR-22) in brain CD4(+) T cells during EAE while suppressing their associated target genes. Similarly, we found that overexpression of miR-16 in primary CD4(+) T cells led to significant downregulation of both mRNA and protein levels of cyclin E1 and B-cell lymphoma-2, which play important roles in regulating cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that DIM post-treatment leads to the amelioration of EAE development by suppressing T-cell responses through the induction of select miRNAs that control cell cycle progression and mediate apoptosis.

24898602	Title	MiR-30b is involved in methylglyoxal-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition of peritoneal mesothelial cells in rats.
24898602	Abstract	Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMC) is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of peritoneal fibrosis. EMT is at least in part caused by repeated exposure to glucose degradation products (GDPs), such as methylglyoxal (MGO). MiRNA contributes greatly to the EMT of PMCs. In this study, we tried to profile whether differences exist between the peritoneal membrane (PM) miRNA expression seen in control rats and that seen in rats injected intraperitoneally with MGO. We assessed whether miR-30b has a possible role in MGO-induced EMT of PMCs in rats. Comparative miRNA expression array and real-time PCR analyses were conducted for the control group at the start of the experiment and for the MGO group after 1 and 2 weeks. During the second week, the MGO rats were treated with: a chemically modified antisense RNA oligonucleotide (ASO) complementary to the mature miR-30b (ASO group); an miR-30b mismatch control sequence (MIS group); or a citrate buffer (EMT group). Bioinformatic analyses indicated that the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of bone morphogenetic protein 7 (BMP7) mRNA did contain a putative binding site for miR-30b. We also tried to investigate whether miR-30b targeted BMP7 in vitro by transfection. Of the upregulated miRNAs, miR-30b expression demonstrated the greatest increase. The administration of miR-30b ASO for two weeks significantly reduced α-SMA excretion and upregulated E-cadherin and BMP-7 expression. Our in vitro study showed that miR-30b directly targeted and inhibited BMP7 by binding to its 3'-UTR. Our results revealed that miR-30b is involved in MGO-induced EMT of PMCs in rats.

24901013	Title	Unraveling natalizumab effects on deregulated miR-17 expression in CD4+ T cells of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis.
24901013	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of noncoding RNAs that play critical roles in the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression. Accumulating evidence supports their involvement in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Here, we compare miR-17 expressions in CD4+ T cells from relapsing-remitting (RR) MS patients treated with natalizumab versus untreated patients. miR-17 was downregulated under natalizumab treatment and upregulated during relapse, therefore supporting a possible role of miR-17 in MS immunopathogenesis. Downregulation of miR-17 was associated with upregulation of PTEN, BIM, E2F1, and p21 target genes. In vitro miR-17 inhibition was associated with upregulation of the same targets and resulted in impaired CD4+ T cell activation and proliferation. We further describe deregulated TGFBR2 expression in untreated patients versus healthy volunteers (HVs) and confirm in vitro the link between miR-17 and TGFBR2 expressions. These findings support an effect of natalizumab on expression of specific miRNA and subsequent expression of genes involved in proliferation and control of the cell cycle.

24903309	Title	MicroRNA-135a acts as a putative tumor suppressor by directly targeting very low density lipoprotein receptor in human gallbladder cancer.
24903309	Abstract	The precise functions and mechanisms of microRNAs (miR) in gallbladder cancer (GBC) remain elusive. In this study, we found that miR-135a-5p expression is often dampened and correlated with neoplasm histologic grade in GBC. MicroRNA-135a-5p introduction clearly inhibited GBC cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), which is often upregulated in GBC tissues, was identified as a direct functional target of miR-135a-5p. Furthermore, the p38 MAPK pathway was proven to be involved in miR-135a-VLDLR downstream signaling. Together, these results suggested that the miR-135a-VLDLR-p38 axis may contribute to GBC cell proliferation.

24912422	Title	MicroRNA-17-5p promotes chemotherapeutic drug resistance and tumour metastasis of colorectal cancer by repressing PTEN expression.
24912422	Abstract	Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide, especially in Western countries. Although chemotherapy is used as an adjuvant or as a palliative treatment, drug resistance poses a great challenge. This study intended to identify biomarkers as predictive factors for chemotherapy. By microarray analysis, we studied miRNAs expression profiles in CRC patient, comparing chemoresistant and chemosensitive groups. The miRNAs of interest were validated and the impact on clinical outcomes was assessed in a cohort of 295 patients. To search for potential targets of these miRNAs, tissue samples were subject to in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry analysis. Colorectal adenocarcinoma cells were also used for in vitro experimentation, where cellular invasiveness and drug resistance were examined in miRNA-transfected cells. The expression level of miRNA-17-5p was found increased in chemoresistant patients. Significantly higher expression levels of miR-17-5p were found in CRC patients with distant metastases and higher clinical stages. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that CRC patients with higher levels of miR-17-5p had reduced survival, especially in patients who had previously received chemotherapy. Overexpression of miR-17-5p promoted COLO205 cell invasiveness. We found that PTEN was a target of miR-17-5p in the colon cancer cells, and their context-specific interactions were responsible for multiple drug-resistance. Chemotherapy was found to increase the expression levels of miR-17-5p, which further repressed PTEN levels, contributing to the development of chemo-resistance. MiR-17-5p is a predictive factor for chemotherapy response and a prognostic factor for overall survival in CRC, which is due to its regulation of PTEN expression.

24913034	Title	Decreased miR-30b-5p expression by DNMT1 methylation regulation involved in gastric cancer metastasis.
24913034	Abstract	miRNAs have emerged as crucial regulators in the regulation of development as well as human diseases, especially tumorigenesis. The aims of this study are to evaluate miR-30b-5p expression pattern and mechanism in gastric carcinogenesis due to which remains to be determined. Expression of miR-30b-5p was analyzed in 51 gastric cancer cases and 4 cell lines by qRT-PCR. The effect of DNA methylation on miR-30b-5p expression was assessed by MSP and BGS. In order to know whether DNMT1 increased miR-30b-5p promoter methylation, DNMT1 was depleted in cell lines AGS and BGC-823. The role of miR-30b-5p on cell migration was evaluated by wound healing assays. Decreased expression of miR-30b-5p was found in gastric cancer samples. In tumor, the expression level of miR-30b-5p was profound correlated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.019). The level of miR-30b-5p may be restored by DNA demethylation and DNMT1 induced miR-30b-5p promoter methylation. In vitro functional assays implied that enforced miR-30b-5p expression affected cell migration, consistent with tissues analysis. Our findings uncovered that miR-30b-5p is significantly diminished in gastric cancer tissues, providing the first insight into the epigenetic mechanism of miR-30b-5p down-regulation, induced by DNMT1, and the role of miR-30b-5p in gastric cancer carcinogenesis. Overexpression of miR-30b-5p inhibited cell migration. Thus, miR-30b-5p may represent a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer therapy.

24913918	Title	MicroRNA-581 promotes hepatitis B virus surface antigen expression by targeting Dicer and EDEM1.
24913918	Abstract	Hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) is an important risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and is downregulated during hepatocarcinogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are frequently deregulated in HCC tissues. However, whether the deregulation of certain miRNAs in HCC has an impact on HBsAg expression remains unclear. We found here that microRNA-581 (miR-581), which is deregulated during hepatocarcinogenesis, promoted HBsAg expression. Additionally, miR-581 targeted Dicer and endoplasmic reticulum degradation-enhancing alpha-mannosidase-like protein 1 (EDEM1) and repressed their expression. Although Dicer cannot process HBV transcripts, Dicer knockdown led to increased HBsAg secretion, most likely due to a reduction in the levels of Dicer-processed 7SL RNA fragments. Moreover, Dicer-processed 7SL RNA fragments partially inhibited the ability of miR-581 to stimulate HBsAg expression. Furthermore, we found that forced EDEM1 expression inhibited miR-581-mediated induction of HBsAg. Finally, transfection of miR-581 into HepG2.2.15 cells promoted cell proliferation and led to upregulation of genes involved in development, cell proliferation and protein secretion. Altogether, we conclude that miR-581 promotes HBsAg expression by targeting Dicer and EDEM1. Our findings suggest that downregulation of miR-581 during hepatocarcinogenesis may lead to a reduction in HBsAg expression and impede HCC development.

24914051	Title	MicroRNA-382 induced by HIF-1Alpha is an angiogenic miR targeting the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog.
24914051	Abstract	Recent studies have revealed that microRNAs (miRs) play important roles in the regulation of angiogenesis. In this study, we have characterized miR-382 upregulation by hypoxia and the functional relevance of miR-382 in tumor angiogenesis. miRs induced by hypoxia in MKN1 human gastric cancer cells were investigated using miRNA microarrays. We selected miR-382 and found that the expression of miR-382 was regulated by HIF-1Alpha. Conditioned media (CM) from MKN1 cells transfected with a miR-382 inhibitor (antagomiR-382) under hypoxic conditions significantly decreased vascular endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, migration and tube formation. Algorithmic programs (Target Scan, miRanda and cbio) predicted that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a target gene of miR-382. Deletion of miR382-binding sequences in the PTEN mRNA 3'-untranslated region (UTR) diminished the luciferase reporter activity. Subsequent study showed that the overexpression of miR-382 or antagomiR-382 down- or upregulated PTEN and its downstream target AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, indicating that PTEN is a functional target gene of miR-382. In addition, PTEN inhibited miR-382-induced in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis as well as VEGF secretion, and the inhibition of miR-382 expression reduced xenograft tumor growth and microvessel density in tumors. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-382 induced by hypoxia promotes angiogenesis and acts as an angiogenic oncogene by repressing PTEN.

24916040	Title	Upregulation of miR-23b enhances the autologous therapeutic potential for degenerative arthritis by targeting PRKACB in synovial fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells from patients.
24916040	Abstract	The use of synovial fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells (SFMSCs) obtained from patients with degenerative arthropathy may serve as an alternative therapeutic strategy in osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). For treatment of OA and RA patients, autologous transplantation of differentiated MSCs has several beneficial effects for cartilage regeneration including immunomodulatory activity. In this study, we induced chondrogenic differentiation of SFMSCs by inhibiting protein kinase A (PKA) with a small molecule and microRNA (miRNA). Chondrogenic differentiation was confirmed by PCR and immunocytochemistry using probes specific for aggrecan, the major cartilaginous proteoglycan gene. Absorbance of alcian blue stain to detect chondrogenic differentiation was increased in H-89 and/or miRNA-23btransfected cells. Furthermore, expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and MMP-2 was decreased in treated cells. Therefore, differentiation of SFMSCs into chondrocytes through inhibition of PKA signaling may be a therapeutic option for OA or RA patients.

24917186	Title	B-cell lymphoma 6 protein stimulates oncogenicity of human breast cancer cells.
24917186	Abstract	B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) protein, an evolutionarily conserved zinc finger transcription factor, showed to be highly expressed in various human cancers in addition to malignancies in the lymphoid system. This study investigated the role of BCL6 expression in breast cancer and its clinical significance in breast cancer patients. Expression of BCL6 protein was assessed using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in 127 breast cancer patients and 50 patients with breast benign disease as well as in breast cell lines. Expression of BCL6 was restored or knocked down in two breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T47D) using BCL6 cDNA and siRNA, respectively. The phenotypic change of these breast cancer cell lines was assessed using cell viability MTT, Transwell invasion, colony formation, and flow cytometry assays and in a xenograft mice model. Luciferase reporter gene, immunoblot, and qRT-PCR were used to investigate the molecular events after manipulated BCL6 expression in breast cancer cells. BCL6 protein was highly expressed in breast cancer cell lines and tissue specimens and expression of BCL6 protein was associated with disease progression and poor survival of breast cancer patients. In vitro, the forced expression of BCL6 results in increased proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, migration, invasion and survival of breast cancer cell lines, whereas knockdown of BCL6 expression reduced these oncogenic properties of breast cancer cells. Moreover, forced expression of BCL6 increased tumor growth and invasiveness in a nude mouse xenograft model. At the gene level, BCL6 was a target gene of miR-339-5p. Expression of BCL6 induced expression of CXCR4 and cyclinD1 proteins. The current study demonstrated the oncogenic property of BCL6 in breast cancer and further study could target BCL6 as a novel potential therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.

24918822	Title	Identification of tumour suppressive microRNA-451a in hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma based on microRNA expression signature.
24918822	Abstract	Hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HSCC) has a very poor prognosis because of its high rates of regional and distant metastasis. Identification of differentially expressed miRNAs and their regulated molecular targets in tumour cells might enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of metastasis in human cancers. A HSCC miRNA signature was constructed by array-based methods. Functional studies of microRNA-451a (miR-451a) and target genes were performed to investigate cell proliferation, migration and invasion by cancer cell lines. To identify miR-451a-regulated molecular targets, we adopted gene expression analysis and in silico database analysis. Our miRNA signature revealed that miR-451a was significantly downregulated in HSCC. Restoration of miR-451a in cancer cell lines revealed that this miRNA significantly inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion. Our data demonstrated that the gene coding for endothelial and smooth muscle cell-derived neuropilin-like molecule (ESDN/DCBLD2) was a direct target of miR-451a regulation. Silencing of ESDN inhibited cell migration and invasion by cancer cells. Loss of tumour suppressive miR-451a enhanced cancer cell migration and invasion in HSCC through direct regulation of ESDN. Our miRNA signature and functional analysis of targets regulated by tumour suppressive miR-451a provide new insights into the potential mechanisms of HSCC oncogenesis and metastasis.

24921914	Title	MiR-224 promotes the chemoresistance of human lung adenocarcinoma cells to cisplatin via regulating G₁/S transition and apoptosis by targeting p21(WAF1/CIP1).
24921914	Abstract	Increasing evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) can serve as oncogenes and tumour suppressors to participate in tumour development. However, the roles of miRNAs in chemoresistance of human lung adenocarcinoma (LA) remain largely undefined. On the basis of miRNA microarray data, miR-224 was identified as the most upregulated miRNA in cisplatin (DDP; cis-diamminedichloroplatinum II)-resistant A549 cells compared with parental A549 cells. The aim of our study was to investigate the roles of miR-224 in the formation of DDP-resistant phenotype of LA cells and its possible molecular mechanisms. Here we showed that miR-224 could promote the in vitro and in vivo DDP resistance of LA cells via regulating G1/S cell cycle transition and apoptosis. p21(WAF1/CIP1), a potent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, was identified as the direct and functional target gene of miR-224. Overexpression of p21(WAF1/CIP1) could phenocopy the effect of miR-224 downregulation and silencing of p21(WAF1/CIP1) could partially reverse the effect of miR-224 downregulation on DDP resistance of DDP-resistant LA cells. In addition, miR-224 could affect the G1/S transition of cell cycle and apoptosis in LA cells through the p21(WAF1/CIP1)-pRb pathway and the intrinsic mitochondrial death pathway. Furthermore, miR-224 was found to be downregulated in DDP-responding LA tissues, and its expression was inversely correlated with p21(WAF1/CIP1). Multivariate analyses indicated that the status of miR-224 might be an independent prognostic factor for predicting the survival of LA patients. Our findings shed novel light on the roles of miR-224/p21(WAF1/CIP1) signalling in the DDP resistance of LA cells, and targeting it will be a potential strategic approach for reversing the DDP resistance in human LAs.

24924414	Title	miR-204 suppresses cochlear spiral ganglion neuron survival in vitro by targeting TMPRSS3.
24924414	Abstract	Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is the most common cause of hearing impairment. One of the essential steps to prevent progressive hearing loss is to protect spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) from ongoing degeneration. MicroRNAs and TMPRSS3 (transmembrane protease, serine 3) have been reported to be involved in development of SGNs and genesis of SNHL. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of miR-204 and TMPRSS3 in SGNs. Effect of miR-204 on cell viability of SGNs was first examined using MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay. Expression of TMPRSS3 in SGNs with or without addition of miR-204 was assessed by real-time PCR and western blot further. A luciferase reporter activity assay was conducted to confirm target association between miR-204 and 3'-UTR of TMPRSS3. Finally, role of TMPRSS3 on cell viability of SGNs was evaluated by transfection of TMPRSS3 siRNA. Cell viability of SGNs was suppressed by miR-204 in a concentration-dependent manner. Overexpression of miR-204 reduced expression of TMPRSS3 in SGNs at both mRNA and protein levels. Binding to the 3'-UTR of TMPRSS3 by miR-204 was identified by luciferase assay. Knockdown of TMPRSS3 by siRNA significantly inhibits cell viability of SGNs. miR-204 could be a potential therapeutic target in sensorineural hearing loss.

24926380	Title	miR-375 inhibits the proliferation of gastric cancer cells by repressing ERBB2 expression.
24926380	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate the expression of targeted genes in a post-transcriptional manner. Increasing evidence indicates that miRNAs play important roles in cancer pathogenesis, including apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation, as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. Previously, miR-375 was shown to be involved in human gastric cancer, however, the mechanism remains poorly understood. In the present study, miR-375 was shown to be downregulated in gastric cancer tissues, particularly human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2)-positive gastric cancer tissues. Identified by dual luciferase assays and western blot analysis, ERBB2 was demonstrated to be a target gene of miR-375. In addition, miR-375 overexpression suppressed the proliferation of human gastric cancer cells in vitro and the suppression effect was restored by ERBB2 overexpression. Thus, the results of the present study indicate that miR-375 is associated with human gastric carcinogenesis by targeting ERBB2. Therefore, miR-375 may be used as a potential clinical classification marker and therapeutic target for human gastric cancer.

24927531	Title	Pitx2-microRNA pathway that delimits sinoatrial node development and inhibits predisposition to atrial fibrillation.
24927531	Abstract	The molecular mechanisms underlying atrial fibrillation, the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, remain poorly understood. Genome-wide association studies uncovered a major atrial fibrillation susceptibility locus on human chromosome 4q25 in close proximity to the paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 2 (Pitx2) homeobox gene. Pitx2, a target of the left-sided Nodal signaling pathway that initiates early in development, represses the sinoatrial node program and pacemaker activity on the left side. To address the mechanisms underlying this repressive activity, we hypothesized that Pitx2 regulates microRNAs (miRs) to repress the sinoatrial node genetic program. MiRs are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression posttranscriptionally. Using an integrated genomic approach, we discovered that Pitx2 positively regulates miR-17-92 and miR-106b-25. Intracardiac electrical stimulation revealed that both miR-17-92 and miR-106b-25 deficient mice exhibit pacing-induced atrial fibrillation. Furthermore electrocardiogram telemetry revealed that mice with miR-17-92 cardiac-specific inactivation develop prolonged PR intervals whereas mice with miR-17-92 cardiac-specific inactivation and miR-106b-25 heterozygosity develop sinoatrial node dysfunction. Both arrhythmias are risk factors for atrial fibrillation in humans. Importantly, miR-17-92 and miR-106b-25 directly repress genes, such as Shox2 and Tbx3, that are required for sinoatrial node development. Together, to our knowledge, these findings provide the first genetic evidence for an miR loss-of-function that increases atrial fibrillation susceptibility.

24927770	Title	MicroRNA response to hypoxic stress in soft tissue sarcoma cells: microRNA mediated regulation of HIF3α.
24927770	Abstract	Hypoxia is often encountered in solid tumors and known to contribute to aggressive tumor behavior, radiation- and chemotherapy resistance resulting in a poor prognosis for the cancer patient. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in the regulation of the tumor cell response to hypoxia, however, not much is known about the involvement of miRNAs in hypoxic signalling pathways in soft tissue sarcomas (STS). A panel of twelve STS cell lines was exposed to atmospheric oxygen concentrations (normoxia) or 1% oxygen (hypoxia) for up to 48 h. Hypoxic conditions were verified and miRNA expression profiles were assessed by LNA™ oligonucleotide microarrays and RT-PCR after 24 h. The expression of target genes regulated by hypoxia responsive miRNAs is examined by end-point PCR and validated by luciferase reporter constructs. Exposure of STS cell lines to hypoxic conditions gave rise to upregulation of Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) 1α protein levels and increased mRNA expression of HIF1 target genes CA9 and VEGFA. Deregulation of miRNA expression after 24 h of hypoxia was observed. The most differentially expressed miRNAs (p<0.001) in response to hypoxia were miR-185-3p, miR-485-5p, miR-216a-5p (upregulated) and miR-625-5p (downregulated). The well-known hypoxia responsive miR-210-3p could not be reliably detected by the microarray platform most likely for technical reasons, however, its upregulation upon hypoxic stress was apparent by qPCR. Target prediction algorithms identified 11 potential binding sites for miR-485-5p and a single putative miR-210-3p binding site in the 3'UTR of HIF3α, the least studied member of the HIF family. We showed that HIF3α transcripts, expressing a 3'UTR containing the miR-485-5p and miR-210-3p target sites, are expressed in all sarcoma cell lines and upregulated upon hypoxia. Additionally, luciferase reporter constructs containing the 3'UTR of HIF3α were used to demonstrate regulation of HIF3α by miR-210-3p and miR-485-5p. Here we provide evidence for the miRNA mediated regulation of HIF3α by hypoxia responsive miRNAs in STS, which may help to tightly regulate and fine-tune the hypoxic response. This provides a better insight into the mechanisms underlying the hypoxic response in STS and may ultimately yield information on novel prognostic and predictive markers or targets for treatment.

24928439	Title	MicroRNAs function as cis- and trans-acting modulators of peripheral circadian clocks.
24928439	Abstract	Based on their extracellular expression and targeting of the clock gene Bmal1, miR-142-3p and miR-494 were analyzed for evidence of vesicle-mediated communication between cells and intracellular functional activity. Our studies demonstrate that: miR-142-3p+miR-494 overexpression decreases endogenous BMAL1 levels, increases the period of Per2 oscillations, and increases extracellular miR-142-3p/miR-494 abundance in conditioned medium; miRNA-enriched medium increases intracellular expression of miR-142-3p and represses Bmal1 3'-UTR activity in naïve cells; and inhibitors of vesicular trafficking modulate intercellular communication of these miRNAs and ensemble Per2 rhythms. Thus, miR-142-3p and miR-494 may function as cis- and trans-acting signals contributing to local temporal coordination of cell-autonomous circadian clocks.

24929254	Title	Downregulation of PPARγ by miR-548d-5p suppresses the adipogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and enhances their osteogenic potential.
24929254	Abstract	Human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) are multipotent cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell types. Elevated expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) promotes the adipogenic differentiation of hBMSCs, and reduces their osteogenic differentiation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in the regulation of hBMSCs differentiation. Because bioinformatic analysis has indicated that PPARγ is a candidate target of miR-548d-5p, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of miR-548d-5p on the dexamethasone-induced adipogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. A quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was used to compare miR-548d-5p expression levels in dexamethasone-induced hBMSCs and uninduced control cells. Oil red O staining, cellular triglyceride (TG) content, and the mRNA and protein levels of PPARγ and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) were used to evaluate the adipogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and levels of osteocalcin (OCN) and Runx2 were used to evaluate the osteogenic potential of hBMSCs. Compared with untreated cells, miR-548d-5p expression levels were downregulated during dexamethasone-induced adipogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. In contrast to the profuse Oil Red O staining in the cytoplasm of dexamethasone + scrambled miRNA-treated cells, there was limited staining in the cytoplasm of dexamethasone + miR-548d-5p-treated cells, indicating the absence of adipocytes. Moreover, compared with scrambled miRNA-treated cells, treatment with miR-548d-5p suppressed cellular levels of PPARγ and C/EBPα mRNA and protein, and cell TG content (P < 0.05). In contrast, compared with scrambled miRNA-treated cells, cellular levels of OCN and Runx2 mRNA and protein, as well as ALP activity, were significantly higher in miR-548d-5p-treated cells (P < 0.05). Western blot and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that miR-548d-5p directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region of PPARγ. miR-548d-5p is downregulated during dexamethasone-induced adipogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. By directly targeting and downregulating PPARγ, miR-548d-5p suppresses the dexamethasone-induced adipogenic differentiation of hBMSCs and enhances their osteogenic potential. Our findings suggest that miR-548d-5p has potential in the treatment of corticosteroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head.

24931256	Title	MiR-503 regulates cisplatin resistance of human gastric cancer cell lines by targeting IGF1R and BCL2.
24931256	Abstract	Studies have shown that the drug resistance of gastric cancer cells can be modulated by abnormal expression of microRNAs (miRNAs). We investigated the role of miR-503 in the development of cisplatin resistance in human gastric cancer cell lines. MiR-503 expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR. MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and clonogenic assays were used to examine changes in cell viability and the drug resistance phenotype of cancer cells associated with upregulation or downregulation of the miRNA. A dual-luciferase activity assay was used to verify target genes of miR-503. Immunohistochemistry, Western blotting analysis, and a flow cytometric apoptosis assay were used to elucidate the mechanism by which miR-503 modulates drug resistance in cancer cells. MiR-503 was significantly downregulated in gastric cancer tissues and several gastric cancer cell lines. Additionally, downregulation of miR-503 in the cisplatin (DDP)-resistant gastric cancer cell line SGC7901/DDP was concurrent with the upregulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) expression compared with the parental SGC7901 cell line. An in vitro drug sensitivity assay showed that overexpression of miR-503 sensitized SGC7901/DDP cells to cisplatin. The luciferase activity of reporters driven by IGF1R and BCL2 3'-untranslated regions in SGC7901/DDP cells suggested that IGF1R and BCL2 were both direct target genes of miR-503. Enforced miR-503 expression in SGC7901/DDP cells reduced expression of the target proteins, inhibited proliferation, and sensitized the cells to DDP-induced apoptosis. Our findings suggest that hsa-miR-503 modulates cisplatin resistance of human gastric cancer cells at least in part by targeting IGF1R and BCL2.

24933454	Title	MicroRNA-196a/-196b promote cell metastasis via negative regulation of radixin in human gastric cancer.
24933454	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role to contribute carcinogenesis. The aim of the current study was to identify useful biomarkers from miRNAs. Differential miRNA profiles were analyzed using the miRNA qRT-PCR-based assay. Two of the most upregulated miRNAs were selected and validated. The miR-196a/-196b levels were significantly increased in gastric cancer (GC) tissues (n=109). Overexpression of miR-196a/-196b was significantly associated with tumor progression and poorer 5-year survival outcomes. Overexpression of miR-196a/-196b enhances GC cell migration and invasion. Further, radixin was identified as a target gene of miR-196a/-196b. Elevated miR-196a/-196b expression in GC cells led to reduced radixin protein levels and vice versa. Notably, an inverse correlation between miR-196a/-196b and radixin mRNA and protein expression was observed in GC tissues with in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry analyses. Together, miR-196a/-196b inhibitory oligonucleotides or overexpression of the radixin may thus have therapeutic potential in suppressing GC metastasis.

24936138	Title	MicroRNA-365 inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation through targeting cyclin D1.
24936138	Abstract	MicroRNA-365 (miR-365) plays crucial roles in regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation in various cell types. However, its function in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is largely unknown. In our study, we found miR-365 was highly expressed in adult rat carotid arteries, but was significantly decreased in rat carotid arteries after balloon injury, a process involving neointima formation and VSMC proliferation. In vitro, the miR-365 significantly inhibited cell proliferation of isolated primary rat aortic VSMCs. Furthermore, we identified that cyclin D1 was a direct target of miR-365 in VSMCs. The miR-365 suppressed cyclin D1 expression on both mRNA and protein level. Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that miR-365 inhibited cyclin D1 through targeting its 3'UTR. Importantly, cyclin D1 overexpression rescued the inhibitory effect of miR-365 on VSMCs proliferation. Taken together, by our studies, we identified a new MicroRNA, miR-365, involving in the pathological process of vascular injury, which inhibits VSMC proliferation through targeting cyclinD1.

24937178	Title	MicroRNA-155 induction by Mycobacterium bovis BCG enhances ROS production through targeting SHIP1.
24937178	Abstract	Macrophages play a critical role in the host immune response against mycobacterial infection. Our previous study has demonstrated that microRNA-155 (miR-155), one of the most important small non-coding RNAs in the immune system, promotes oxygen-independent mycobacterial killing in macrophages. However, little is known regarding the role of miR-155 in modulating oxygen-dependent mycobactericidal response in macrophages, including the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). In the present study, we demonstrated that miR-155 was increased in macrophages after Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) infection. Moreover, the BCG-induced upregulation of miR-155 in macrophages was dependent on TLR2, NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways. More importantly, our study explored that miR-155 significantly elevated ROS production in macrophages, although miR-155 had no influence on the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression or nitric oxide (NO) production. In addition, our study demonstrated that miR-155 repressed the expression of src homology 2 (SH2) containing inositol 5-phosphatase1 (SHIP1), and knockdown of SHIP1 greatly increased ROS production in BCG-infected macrophages. Collectively, these data indicate that miR-155 modulates ROS but not RNS production by targeting SHIP1, which may provide a better understanding of the host anti-mycobacterial response.

24937190	Title	miR-141-3p inhibits human stromal (mesenchymal) stem cell proliferation and differentiation.
24937190	Abstract	Wnt signaling determines human stromal (mesenchymal) stem cell (hMSC) differentiation fate into the osteoblast or adipocyte lineage. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules of 21-25 nucleotides that regulate many aspects of osteoblast biology. Thus, we examined miRNAs regulated by Wnt signaling in hMSC. We identified miRNA (miR)-141-3p as a Wnt target which in turn inhibited Wnt signaling. Moreover, miR-141-3p inhibited hMSC proliferation by arresting cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. miR-141-3p inhibited osteoblast differentiation of hMSC as evidenced by reduced alkaline phosphatase activity, gene expression and in vitro mineralized matrix formation. Bioinformatic studies, Western blot analysis and 3'UTR reporter assay demonstrated that cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A) is a direct target of miR-141-3p. siRNA-mediated knock-down of CDC25A inhibited hMSC proliferation and osteoblast differentiation. In summary, miR-141-3p acts as a negative regulator of hMSC proliferation and osteoblast differentiation. Targeting miR-141-3p could be used as an anabolic therapy of low bone mass diseases, e.g. osteoporosis.

24939082	Title	Role of miR-146a in human chondrocyte apoptosis in response to mechanical pressure injury in vitro.
24939082	Abstract	MicroRNA (miR)-146a is known to be overexpressed in osteoarthritis (OA). However, the role of miR-146a in OA has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we applied mechanical pressure of 10 MPa to human chondrocytes for 60 min in order to investigate the expression of miR-146a and apoptosis following the mechanical pressure injury. Normal human chondrocytes were transfected with an miR-146a mimic or an inhibitor to regulate miR-146a expression. Potential target genes of miR-146a were predicted using bioinformatics. Moreover, luciferase reporter assay confirmed that Smad4 was a direct target of miR-146a. The expression levels of miR-146a, Smad4 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were quantified by quantitative reverse transcription PCR and/or western blot analysis. The effects of miR-146a on apoptosis were detected by Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide (PI) flow cytometry. The results indicated that mechanical pressure affected chondrocyte viability and induced the early apoptosis of chondrocytes. Mechanical pressure injury increased the expression levels of miR-146a and VEGF and decreased the levels of Smad4 in the chondrocytes. In the human chondrocytes, the upregulation of miR-146a induced apoptosis, upregulated VEGF expression and downregulated Smad4 expression. In addition, the knockdown of miR-146a reduced cell apoptosis, upregulated Smad4 expression and downregulated VEGF expression. Smad4 was identified as a direct target of miR-146a by harboring a miR‑146a binding sequence in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of its mRNA. Furthermore, the upregulation of VEGF induced by miR‑146a was mediated by Smad4 in the chondrocytes subjected to mechanical pressure injury. These results demonstrated that miR-146a was overexpressed in our chondrocyte model of experimentally induced human mechanical injury, accompanied by the upregulation of VEGF and the downregulation of Smad4 in vitro. Moreover, our data suggest that miR-146a is involved in human chondrocyte apoptosis in response to mechanical injury, and may contribute to the mechanical injury of chondrocytes, as well as to the pathogenesis of OA by increasing the levels of VEGF and damaging the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling pathway through the targeted inhibition of Smad4 in cartilage.

24940073	Title	miR-544a promotes the invasion of lung cancer cells by targeting cadherina 1 in vitro.
24940073	Abstract	To find out the effect of miR-544a on the invasion of lung cancer cells and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. Micro-ribonucleic acid (miRNA) expression in two different invasive lung cancer cell lines 95C (low invasive ability) and 95D (high invasive ability) was analyzed by miRNA microarray and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR); miR-544a mimic was transfected to 95C, and its invasion ability was detected by transwell migration assay; we predicted the candidate miRNA target genes by TargetScan (Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, Cambridge, MA, USA) software and verified the target genes by Western blot. The expression of miR-544a was significantly increased in 95D in miRNA microarray and quantitative PCR tests (P<0.05). After being transfected with miR-544a mimic, the invasion ability of 95C was enhanced (P<0.01). Moreover, transfection with miR-544a inhibitor decreased the invasion ability of 95D (P<0.01). miR-544a possibly combined with CDH1 (E-cadherin) predicted by the TargetScan analysis. 95C with miR-544a mimic reduced the expression of CDH1 and improved the expression of vimentin, while 95D with miR-544a inhibitor improved the expression of CDH1 and reduced the expression of vimentin. miR-544a can promote the invasion of non-small cell lung cancer by downregulation of CDH1 and upregulation of vimentin.

24940696	Title	miR-211 modulates gemcitabine activity through downregulation of ribonucleotide reductase and inhibits the invasive behavior of pancreatic cancer cells.
24940696	Abstract	Only a subset of radically-resected pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients benefit from gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, thus the identification of novel prognostic factors is essential. In a high-throughput, microRNA (miRNA) array, miR-211 emerged as the best discriminating miRNA, with high expression associated with long survival. Here, we further explored the biological role of miRNA-211 in gemcitabine activity in the human PDAC cells (SUIT-2) subclones SUIT2-007 and SUIT2-028. Our results showed that miR-211 was expressed differentially in PDAC cells characterized by differential metastatic capability. In particular, S2-028 with lower metastatic ability had a higher expression of miR-211, compared to the S2-007 with higher metastatic capacity. Enforced expression of miR-211 via pre-miR-211 significantly reduced cell migration and invasion (e.g., 40% reduction of invasion of SUIT2 cells, compared to control; p<.05). Moreover, we demonstrated that induction of the miR-211 expression in the cells increased the sensitivity to gemcitabine and reduced the expression of its target ribonucleotide reductase subunit 2 (RRM2). In conclusion, miR-211 functional analyses suggested the role of RRM2 as a target of miR-211 in the modulation of gemcitabine sensitivity. Moreover, inhibition of cell migration and invasion might explain the less aggressive behavior of pancreatic cancer cells with higher expression levels of miR-211.

24942165	Title	Next-generation sequencing of small RNAs from inner ear sensory epithelium identifies microRNAs and defines regulatory pathways.
24942165	Abstract	The mammalian inner ear contains sensory organs, the organ of Corti in the cochlea and cristae and maculae in the vestibule, with each comprised of patterned sensory epithelia that are responsible for hearing and balance. The development, cell fate, patterning, and innervation of both the sensory and nonsensory regions of the inner ear are governed by tight regulation involving, among others, transcription factors and microRNAs (miRNAs). In humans, mutations in specific miRNA genes are associated with hearing loss. In mice, experimental reduction or mutations of miRNAs in the inner ear leads to severe developmental and structural abnormalities. A comprehensive identification of miRNAs in the sensory epithelia and their gene targets will enable pathways of auditory and vestibular function to be defined. In this study, we used Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) to identify the most prominent miRNAs in the inner ear and to define miRNA-target pairs that form pathways crucial for the function of the sensory epithelial cells. NGS of RNA from inner ear sensory epithelial cells led to the identification of 455 miRNAs in both cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelium, with 30 and 44 miRNAs found in only cochlea or vestibule, respectively. miR-6715-3p and miR-6715-5p were defined for the first time in the inner ear. Gene targets were identified for each of these miRNAs, including Arhgap12, a GTPase activating protein, for miR-6715-3p, implicating this miRNA in sensory hair cell bundle development, actin reorganization, cell adhesion and inner ear morphogenesis. This study provides a comprehensive atlas of miRNAs in the inner ear sensory epithelia. The results provide further support of the essential regulatory role of miRNAs in inner ear sensory epithelia and in regulating pathways that define development and growth of these cells.

24942287	Title	Post-transcriptional regulation of the tumor suppressor miR-139-5p and a network of miR-139-5p-mediated mRNA interactions in colorectal cancer.
24942287	Abstract	MicroRNAs play key roles in many biological processes, and are frequently dysregulated in tumor cells. However, there are few studies on how microRNAs are dysregulated. miR-139-5p, an important tumor suppressor, is often underexpressed in gastrointestinal cancer cells. Here, we describe post-transcriptional regulation of this intronic microRNA in human colorectal cancer. miR-139-5p is expressed independently of its overexpressed host gene PDE2A in colorectal cancer tissues and cell lines. The miR-139-5p target genes IGF1R, ROCK2 and RAP1B exert regulatory effects on the miR-139-5p expression level, relying on their ability to compete for miR-139-5p binding. These overexpressed target genes also regulate each others' protein levels through 3'-UTRs, thus regulating tumor cell growth and motility properties. Our study provides a mechanistic, experimentally validated rationale for intronic microRNA dysregulation in colorectal cancer, revealing novel oncogenic roles of IGF1R, ROCK2 and RAP1B 3'-UTRs.

24942805	Title	Berberine-induced tumor suppressor p53 up-regulation gets involved in the regulatory network of MIR-23a in hepatocellular carcinoma.
24942805	Abstract	To investigate the involvement of p53 in the regulatory network of microRNA-23a (miR-23a) in berberine-treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The biogenesis of miR-23a upon berberine treatment was monitored by detecting the transcript expression of primary precursor, precursor and mature forms of miR-23a. Protein expression was detected with immunoblotting. The binding capacity between p53 and chromatin DNA was determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation. The role of miR-23a in mediating suppression of HCC by berberine was determined both in vitro and in vivo. miR-23a was up-regulated upon berberine treatment in human HCC cells, and berberine could increase the expression of primary precursor, precursor and mature forms of miR-23a. The up-regulation of miR-23a by berberine is p53-dependent. Inhibition of p53 expression and activity could block the up-regulation of miR-23a induced by berberine. Furthermore, berberine-induced miR-23a expression may mediate the transcription activation of p53-related tumor suppressive genes p21 and GADD45α. Inhibition of miR-23a abolishes the binding of p53 onto chromatin and attenuates transcription activation of p21 and GADD45α. Target prediction and experimental validation demonstrate that berberine-induced miR-23a may target to Nek6 to suppress its expression. Berberine-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest in HCC was attenuated when miR-23a was inhibited. Berberine-induced cell death and in vivo tumor growth inhibition are attenuated upon inhibition of miR-23a. Our study reveals that miR-23a may be involved in regulating the anti-HCC effect of berberine by mediating the regulation of p53.

24944883	Title	Tumor suppressive miRNA-34a suppresses cell proliferation and tumor growth of glioma stem cells by targeting Akt and Wnt signaling pathways.
24944883	Abstract	MiRNA-34a is considered as a potential prognostic marker for glioma, as studies suggest that its expression negatively correlates with patient survival in grade III and IV glial tumors. Here, we show that expression of miR-34a was decreased in a graded manner in glioma and glioma stem cell-lines as compared to normal brain tissues. Ectopic expression of miR-34a in glioma stem cell-lines HNGC-2 and NSG-K16 decreased the proliferative and migratory potential of these cells, induced cell cycle arrest and caused apoptosis. Notably, the miR-34a glioma cells formed significantly smaller xenografts in immuno-deficient mice as compared with control glioma stem cell-lines. Here, using a bioinformatics approach and various biological assays, we identify Rictor, as a novel target for miR-34a in glioma stem cells. Rictor, a defining component of mTORC2 complex, is involved in cell survival signaling. mTORC2 lays downstream of Akt, and thus is a direct activator of Akt. Our earlier studies have elaborated on role of Rictor in glioma invasion (Das et al., 2011). Here, we demonstrate that miR34a over-expression in glioma stem cells profoundly decreased levels of p-AKT (Ser473), increased GSK-3β levels and targeted for degradation β-catenin, an important mediator of Wnt signaling pathway. This led to diminished levels of the Wnt effectors cyclin D1 and c-myc. Collectively, we show that the tumor suppressive function of miR-34a in glioblastoma is mediated via Rictor, which through its effects on AKT/mTOR pathway and Wnt signaling causes pronounced effects on glioma malignancy.

24945731	Abstract	The dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is crucially implicated in the development of various cancers. In this study, we explored the biological role of miR-141 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). miR-141 expression was significantly up-regulated in NSCLC tissues, and its overexpression accelerated NSCLC cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. We subsequently identified the antagonists of PI3K/AKT signaling, PH domain leucine-rich-repeats protein phosphatase 1 (PHLPP1) and PHLPP2, as direct targets of miR-141. Re-introduction of PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 abrogated miR-141-induced proliferation of NSCLC cells. Together, the results of this study suggest that miR-141 and its targets PHLPP1 and PHLPP2 play critical roles in NSCLC tumorigenesis, and provide potential therapeutic targets for NSCLC treatment.

24951777	Title	miR-210 promotes IPF fibroblast proliferation in response to hypoxia.
24951777	Abstract	Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterized by the relentless spread of fibroblasts from scarred alveoli into adjacent alveolar units, resulting in progressive hypoxia and death by asphyxiation. Although hypoxia is a prominent clinical feature of IPF, the role of hypoxia as a driver of the progressive fibrotic nature of the disease has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia robustly stimulates the proliferation of IPF fibroblasts. We found that miR-210 expression markedly increases in IPF fibroblasts in response to hypoxia and that knockdown of miR-210 decreases hypoxia-induced IPF fibroblast proliferation. Silencing hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-2α inhibits the hypoxia-mediated increase in miR-210 expression and blocks IPF fibroblast proliferation, indicating that HIF-2α is upstream of miR-210. We demonstrate that the miR-210 downstream target MNT is repressed in hypoxic IPF fibroblasts and that knockdown of miR-210 increases MNT expression. Overexpression of MNT inhibits hypoxia-induced IPF fibroblast proliferation. Together, these data indicate that hypoxia potently stimulates miR-210 expression via HIF-2α, and high miR-210 expression drives fibroblast proliferation by repressing the c-myc inhibitor, MNT. In situ analysis of IPF lung tissue demonstrates miR-210 expression in a similar distribution with HIF-2α and the hypoxic marker carbonic anhydrase-IX in cells within the IPF fibrotic reticulum. Our results raise the possibility that a pathological feed-forward loop exists in the IPF lung, in which hypoxia promotes IPF fibroblast proliferation via stimulation of miR-210 expression, which in turn worsens hypoxia.

24953987	Title	Upregulation of let-7a inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation in vitro and in vein graft intimal hyperplasia in rats.
24953987	Abstract	Proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is a crucial event in the pathogenesis of intimal hyperplasia, which is the main cause of restenosis after vascular reconstruction. In this study, we assessed the impact of let-7a microRNA (miRNA) on the proliferation of VSMCs. Using miRNA microarrays analysis for miRNA expression in the vein graft model. Lentiviral vector-mediated let-7a was transfected into the vein grafts. In situ hybridization was performed to detect let-7a. Cultured rat VSMCs were transfected with let-7a mimics for different periods of time. Cell proliferation, migration and cell cycle activity were monitored following transfection of the let-7a mimics. Immunohistochemical and Western blotting analysis the expression levels of c-myc and K-ras. We found that let-7a was the most downregulated miRNA in the vein graft model. In vivo proliferation of VSMCs was assessed in a rat model of venous graft intimal hyperplasia. Let-7a was found to localize mainly to the VSMCs. Let-7a miRNA expression was increased in VSMCs in the neointima of the let-7a treated group. Intimal hyperplasia was suppressed by upregulation of let-7a via lentiviral vector-mediated mimics. In cultured VSMCs, the expression of let-7a increased upon starving, and the upregulation of let-7a miRNA significantly decreased cell proliferation and migration. Immunohistochemical and Western blotting analysis demonstrated that treatment with let-7a mimics resulted in decreased expression levels of c-myc and K-ras. The results indicate that let-7a miRNA is a novel regulator of VSMC proliferation in intimal hyperplasia. These findings suggest that let-7a miRNA is a promising therapeutic target for the prevention of intimal hyperplasia.

24954667	Abstract	The role of microRNA-30a (miR-30a) deregulation in tumor progression and its downstream signaling pathways remain unknown. Here we confirmed significant downregulation of miR-30a in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues and cell lines compared with non-tumor counterparts. MiR-30a downregulation was significantly associated with worse disease-free survival (DFS) of HCC patients. Gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that downregulation of miR-30a facilitated tumor cell migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We identified SNAI1 as a direct target of miR-30a and demonstrated miR-30a as a novel regulator of EMT by targeting SNAI1, indicating its potential therapeutic value for reducing invasion and metastasis of HCC.

24959893	Title	MiR-133b regulates the expression of the Actin protein TAGLN2 during oocyte growth and maturation: a potential target for infertility therapy.
24959893	Abstract	Infertility is an area of increasing in life science research. Although follicular maturation disorders and anovulation are the primary causations of infertility, its molecular mechanism is not well understood. Recent research has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) might play an important role in the regulation of ovarian follicle development and maturation. In this study, the expression of miRNAs in metaphase I (MI) oocytes treated with or without insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was observed by microRNA microarray analysis. Results show that 145 miRNAs were up-regulated and 200 miRNAs were down-regulated in MI oocytes after IGF-1 treatment. MiR-133b, which was up-regulated more than 30-fold, was chosen for further research. As a potential target of miR133b, transgelin 2 (TAGLN2) gene was down-regulated, at both transcription and translation levels, in miR-133b- over-expressed 293T cells, but TAGLN2 was up-regulated when the expression of miR-133b was inhibited. Furthermore, the expression level of TAGLN2 in the ovaries of 8-week- old mice was higher than that observed in 4-week-old mice. Immunofluorescence experiments showed that TAGLN2 was located in the cytoplasm. In general, our results indicate that miR-133b may play important roles in the growth and maturation of oocytes by regulating its potential target, TAGLN2, at both transcription and translation levels. Therefore, our research provides a potential new target for infertility therapy.

24966325	Title	The microRNA-23b/27b/24 cluster promotes breast cancer lung metastasis by targeting metastasis-suppressive gene prosaposin.
24966325	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to function as key regulators of tumor progression and metastasis. Recent studies have indicated that the miRNAs comprising the miR-23b/27b/24 cluster might influence tumor metastasis, although the precise nature of this regulation remains unclear. Here, expression of the miR-23b/27b/24 cluster is found to correlate with metastatic potential in mouse and human breast cancer cell lines and is elevated in metastatic lung lesions in human breast cancer patients. Ectopic expression of the miRNAs in the weakly metastatic mouse 4TO7 mammary tumor cell line had no effect on proliferation or morphology of tumor cells in vitro but was found to increase lung metastasis in a mouse model of breast cancer metastasis. Furthermore, gene expression profiling analysis of miRNA overexpressing 4TO7 cells revealed the direct targeting of prosaposin (PSAP), which encodes a secreted protein found to be inversely correlated with metastatic progression in human breast cancer patients. Importantly, ectopic expression of PSAP was able to suppress the metastatic phenotype in highly metastatic 4T1 and MDA-MB-231 SCP28 cells, as well as in cells ectopically expressing miR-23b/27b/24. These findings support a metastasis-promoting function of the miR-23b/27b/24 cluster of miRNAs, which functions in part through the direct inhibition of PSAP.

24969300	Title	Mir-126 inhibits growth of SGC-7901 cells by synergistically targeting the oncogenes PI3KR2 and Crk, and the tumor suppressor PLK2.
24969300	Abstract	MicroRNA (miRNA)-126 (miR-126) was reported to be downregulated and to act as a tumor suppressor in cancers of the lung, cervix, bladder and prostate. However, the functions of miR-126 in gastric cancer appear to be diverse and are largely unknown. MiR-126 was reported to act as a tumor suppressor by targeting the Crk gene, or as an oncogene by targeting the SOX2 gene in gastric cancer. We identified that the expression of miR-126 was decreased in gastric cancer cell lines and tissues. PLK2, a tumor suppressor gene, was directly regulated by miR-126 in SGC-7901 cells. Overexpression of miR-126 not only suppressed the growth and clone formation of SGC-7901 cells, but also induced apoptosis in vitro, whereas inhibition of miR-126 slightly promoted SGC-7901 cell proliferation. The cell cycle was not affected by miR-126. Moreover, miR-126 suppressed tumor growth in vivo in a xenograft model. PLK2, PI3KR2 and Crk were regulated by miR-126 in SGC-7901 cells. We infer that the functions of miR-126 in gastric cancer depend on synergistic targeting balance between oncogenes and anti-oncogenes. Our study indicates that miR-126 is a tumor suppressor, which in the future may become a therapeutic target for gastric cancer.

24969405	Title	Downregulation of microRNA-155 accelerates cell growth and invasion by targeting c-myc in human gastric carcinoma cells.
24969405	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered class of small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. miRNAs can contribute to cancer development and progression and are differentially expressed in normal tissue and cancer. In the present study, our aim was to investigate the expression of miR-155 in gastric cancer and to explore the mechanisms by which it influences gastric cancer cells. The level of miR-155 in 52 gastric carcinoma and corresponding non-tumor tissues was quantified by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. We used the data from EdU, CASY and cell adhesion assays to show how the expression of miR-155 affects viability and proliferation in SGC-7901 cancer cells. We also performed functional assays using the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the c-myc gene as a miR-155 target in a luciferase reporter assay system. Our results indicated that miR-155 is downregulated in both human gastric carcinoma tissues and SGC-7901 cells. The high expression level of miR-155 may significantly downregulate cancer cell viability, proliferation and attachment. The level of miR-155 could influence endogenous c-myc expression in SGC-7901 cells, and may decrease its expression by binding to 3'-UTR of c-myc. In conclusion, our results suggest that miR-155 is extensively involved in the cancer pathogenesis of gastric carcinoma and support its function as recessive cancer genes. c-myc is an important miR-155 target gene.

24969565	Title	lncRNA-AC130710 targeting by miR-129-5p is upregulated in gastric cancer and associates with poor prognosis.
24969565	Abstract	Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in cancer occurrence and development. However, there is largely unknown about lncRNAs significance in the diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer. In our study, we focused on AC130710, one of lncRNAs. Gastric cancer tissues and adjacent tissues were gathered from 78 patients with gastric cancer. The AC130710 levels were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Then, we further analyzed the association between AC130710 level and the clinicopathological factors of patients with gastric cancer. Finally, the molecular mechanism underling AC130710 highly expressed in gastric cancer cells was explored. The results showed that AC130710 in cancer tissues from patients with gastric cancer was significantly higher than those in adjacent noncancerous tissues (P < 0.05). Its expression level was significantly associated with tumor size (P = 0.013), tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages (P = 0.030), and distal metastasis (P = 0.018). AC130710 expression in MGC-803 was significantly higher than that in normal gastric mucosa cell line GES-1 (P < 0.001). Moreover, miR-129-5p may play an important role in the downregulation of AC130710 in gastric cancer cells. These results indicated that lncRNA-AC130710 may be a potential tumor marker for gastric cancer prognosis.

24970806	Title	miR-942 decreases TRAIL-induced apoptosis through ISG12a downregulation and is regulated by AKT.
24970806	Abstract	Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is an attractive death ligand in targeted cancer therapy. Many cancer cells are refractory to TRAIL-induced cell death and the mechanisms underlying resistance are unclear. The molecular mechanisms of HCC and gastric cancer cells resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis were explored using molecular biological and immunological methods. In vivo experiments were conducted to study the effect of interferon stimulated gene 12a (ISG12a) on human liver cancer xenografts in mice. ISG12a decreases in TRAIL-resistant cancer cells. ISG12a regulates the sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAIL in vitro and in vivo. MicroRNA-942 (miR-942) is inversely correlated with ISG12a expression in cancer cells and tissues. Forced expression of miR-942 in TRAIL-sensitive cells significantly reduces endogenous ISG12a level and changes the TRAIL sensitive phenotype to a resistant one. Knockdown of miR-942 expression in TRAIL-resistant cells restores the expression of ISG12a and sensitizes the cells to TRAIL treatment. AKT control TRAIL resistance of cancer cells through downregulation of ISG12a by miR-942. Downregulation of ISG12a by miR-942 is needed to maintain the TRAIL-resistant phenotype of cancer cells and favors cancer cell survival. MiR-942 may offer a novel drug response marker with important implications in designing new therapeutics for TRAIL resistant tumors.

24970812	Title	Yin Yang 1 is a target of microRNA-34 family and contributes to gastric carcinogenesis.
24970812	Abstract	Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Herein, we investigated the role of transcription factor Yin Yang 1 (YY1), a multi-functional protein, in tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells. Results showed that YY1 contributed to gastric carcinogenesis of SC-M1 cells including growth, viability, and abilities of colony formation, migration, invasion, and tumorsphere formation. Levels of pluripotency genes CD44, Oct4, SOX-2, and Nanog were also up-regulated by YY1 in SC-M1 cells. Additionally, the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of YY1 mRNA was the target of microRNA-34 (miR-34) family consisting of miR-34a, miR-34b, and miR-34c. Overexpression of miR-34 family suppressed carcinogenesis through down-regulation of YY1 in NUGC-3 gastric cancer cells scarcely expressing miR-34 family. Alternatively, knockdown of miR-34 family promoted tumorigenesis via up-regulation of YY1 in SC-M1 and AZ521 gastric cancer cells with higher levels of miR-34 family. The miR-34 family also affected tumorsphere ultra-structure and inhibited the xenografted tumor growth as well as lung metastasis of SC-M1 cells through YY1. Expressions of miR-34a and miR-34c in gastric cancer tissues of patients were lower than those in normal tissues. Taken together, these results suggest that miR-34 family-YY1 axis plays an important role in the control of gastric carcinogenesis.

24971532	Title	miR-182 targets CHL1 and controls tumor growth and invasion in papillary thyroid carcinoma.
24971532	Abstract	In this study, we investigated the role and underlying mechanism of action of miR-182 in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Bioinformatics analysis revealed close homolog of LI (CHL1) as a potential target of miR-182. Upregulation of miR-182 was significantly correlated with CHL1 downregulation in human PTC tissues and cell lines. miR-182 suppressed the expression of CHL1 mRNA through direct targeting of the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR). Downregulation of miR-182 suppressed growth and invasion of PTC cells. Silencing of CHL1 counteracted the effects of miR-182 suppression, while its overexpression mimicked these effects. Our data collectively indicate that miR-182 in PTC promotes cell proliferation and invasion through direct suppression of CHL1, supporting the potential utility of miR-182 inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy against PTC.

24978044	Title	Differentially expressed plasma microRNAs and the potential regulatory function of Let-7b in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.
24978044	Abstract	Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a progressive disease characterized by misguided thrombolysis and remodeling of pulmonary arteries. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs involved in multiple cell processes and functions. During CTEPH, circulating microRNA profile endued with characteristics of diseased cells could be identified as a biomarker, and might help in recognition of pathogenesis. Thus, in this study, we compared the differentially expressed microRNAs in plasma of CTEPH patients and healthy controls and investigated their potential functions. Microarray was used to identify microRNA expression profile and qRT-PCR for validation. The targets of differentially expressed microRNAs were identified in silico, and the Gene Ontology database and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway database were used for functional investigation of target gene profile. Targets of let-7b were validated by fluorescence reporter assay. Protein expression of target genes was determined by ELISA or western blotting. Cell migration was evaluated by wound healing assay. The results showed that 1) thirty five microRNAs were differentially expressed in CTEPH patients, among which, a signature of 17 microRNAs, which was shown to be related to the disease pathogenesis by in silico analysis, gave diagnostic efficacy of both sensitivity and specificity >0.9. 2) Let-7b, one of the down-regulated anti-oncogenic microRNAs in the signature, was validated to decrease to about 0.25 fold in CTEPH patients. 3) ET-1 and TGFBR1 were direct targets of let-7b. Altering let-7b level influenced ET-1 and TGFBR1 expression in pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAECs) as well as the migration of PAECs and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). These results suggested that CTEPH patients had aberrant microRNA signature which might provide some clue for pathogenesis study and biomarker screening. Reduced let-7b might be involved in the pathogenesis of CTEPH by affecting ET-1 expression and the function of PAECs and PASMCs.

24982425	Title	The regulatory roles of microRNA-146b-5p and its target platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) in erythropoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis.
24982425	Abstract	Emerging evidence has shown that microRNAs have key roles in regulating various normal physiological processes, whereas their deregulated expression is correlated with various diseases. The miR-146 family includes miR-146a and miR-146b, with a distinct expression spectrum in different hematopoietic cells. Recent work indicated that miR-146a has a close relationship with inflammation and autoimmune diseases. miR-146-deficient mice have developed some abnormal hematopoietic phenotypes, suggesting the potential functions of miR-146 in hematopoietic development. In this study, we found that miR-146b was consistently up-regulated in both K562 and CD34(+) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) undergoing either erythroid or megakaryocytic differentiation. Remarkably, erythroid and megakaryocytic maturation of K562 cells was induced by excess miR-146b but inhibited by decreased miR-146b levels. More importantly, an mRNA encoding receptor tyrosine kinase, namely platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA), was identified and validated as a direct target of miR-146b in hematopoietic cells. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays showed that PDGFRA functioned as a negative regulator in erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation. miR-146b could ultimately affect the expression of the GATA-1 gene, which is regulated by HEY1 (Hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif protein 1), a transcriptional repressor, via inhibition of the PDGFRA/JNK/JUN/HEY1 pathway. Lentivirus-mediated gene transfer also demonstrated that the overexpression of miR-146b promoted erythropoiesis and megakaryocytopoiesis of HSPCs via its regulation on the PDGFRA gene and effects on GATA-1 expression. Moreover, we confirmed that the binding of GATA-1 to the miR-146b promoter and induction of miR-146b during hematopoietic maturation were dependent on GATA-1. Therefore, miR-146b, PDGFRA, and GATA-1 formed a regulatory circuit to promote erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation.

24984017	Title	Decreased miR-204 in H. pylori-associated gastric cancer promotes cancer cell proliferation and invasion by targeting SOX4.
24984017	Abstract	The molecular mechanism between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and gastric cancer remained largely unknown. In this study, we determined the role of miRNA in H. pylori induced gastric cancer. We found that miR-204 was decreased in H. pylori positive tissues by qRT-PCR. Knockdown of miR-204 enhanced the invasion and proliferation ability of gastric cancer cells in vitro. Luciferase assay revealed that SOX4 was target gene of miR-204, which was found up-regulated in H. pylori positive tissues. Down-regulation of miR-204 and over-expression of SOX4 promoted epithelial-mesenchymal transition process. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that miR-204 may act as a tumor suppressor in H. pylori induced gastric cancer by targeting SOX4.

24985472	Title	MicroRNA-146 inhibits thrombin-induced NF-κB activation and subsequent inflammatory responses in human retinal endothelial cells.
24985472	Abstract	Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), a key regulator of immune and inflammatory responses, plays important roles in diabetes-induced microvascular complications including diabetic retinopathy (DR). Thrombin activates NF-κB through protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1, a member of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily, and contributes to DR. The current study is to uncover the roles of microRNA (miRNA) in thrombin-induced NF-κB activation and retinal endothelial functions. Target prediction was performed using the TargetScan algorithm. Predicted target was experimentally validated by luciferase reporter assays. Human retinal endothelial cells (HRECs) were transfected with miRNA mimics or antimiRs and treated with thrombin. Expression levels of miR-146 and related protein-coding genes were analyzed by quantitative (q)RT-PCR. Functional changes of HRECs were analyzed by leukocyte adhesion assays. We identified that caspase-recruitment domain (CARD)-containing protein 10 (CARD10), an essential scaffold/adaptor protein of GPCR-mediated NF-κB activation pathway, is a direct target of miR-146. Thrombin treatment resulted in NF-κB-dependent upregulation of miR-146 in HRECs; while transfection of miR-146 mimics resulted in significant downregulation of CARD10 and prevented thrombin-induced NF-κB activation, suggest that a negative feedback regulation of miR-146 on thrombin-induced NF-κB through targeting CARD10. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-146 prevented thrombin-induced increased leukocyte adhesion to HRECs. We uncovered a novel negative feedback regulatory mechanism on thrombin-induced GPCR-mediated NF-κB activation by miR-146. In combination with the negative feedback regulation of miR-146 on the IL-1R/toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated NF-κB activation in RECs that we reported previously, our results underscore a pivotal, negative regulatory role of miR-146 on multiple NF-κB activation pathways and related inflammatory processes in DR.

24988056	Title	Luteolin Induces Apoptosis by Up-regulating miR-34a in Human Gastric Cancer Cells.
24988056	Abstract	Luteolin (39, 49, 5, 7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a natural flavonoid that exists in several types of vegetables, fruits, and medicinal herbs that inhibits tumorigenesis in different types of cancer. In this study, we demonstrate luteolin-mediated regulation of cell apoptosis in a gastric cancer cell line through inhibition of the apoptosis regulatory protein Bcl-2. MTT and flow cytometric analysis indicate that luteolin inhibits cell proliferation and induces apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed that miR-34a expression is downregulated in the majority of human primary gastric cancer tissues (8/12, 66.7%), compared with adjacent, pair-matched non-tumor tissues. Target analysis indicated that micro RNA (miR)-34a directly regulates Bcl-2, and miR-34a overexpression decreased Bcl-2 protein level in gastric cancer cells. We also found that luteolin upregulates miR-34a expression and downregulates Bcl-2 expression. Furthermore, anti-miR-34a oligonucleotides (AMO) partly reverse luteolin-induced Bcl-2 downregulation in gastric cancer cells. Based on these results, we can draw the conclusion that luteolin partly decreases Bcl-2 expression through upregulating miR-34a expression. This study shows for the first time that the miR-34a pathway plays an important role in luteolin-induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells.

24989082	Title	SS18-SSX-regulated miR-17 promotes tumor growth of synovial sarcoma by inhibiting p21WAF1/CIP1.
24989082	Abstract	MicroRNA (miRNA) can function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes, and also as potential specific cancer biomarkers; however, there are few published studies on miRNA in synovial sarcomas, and their function remains unclear. We transfected the OncomiR miRNA Precursor Virus Library into synovial sarcoma Fuji cells followed by a colony formation assay to identify miRNAs to confer an aggressive tumorigenicity, and identified miR-17-5p from the large colonies. MiR-17 was found to be induced by a chimeric oncoprotein SS18-SSX specific for synovial sarcoma, and all examined cases of human synovial sarcoma expressed miR-17, even at high levels in several cases. Overexpression of miR-17 in synovial sarcoma cells, Fuji and HS-SYII, increased colony forming ability in addition to cell growth, but not cell motility and invasion. Tumor volume formed in mice in vivo was significantly increased by miR-17 overexpression with a marked increase of MIB-1 index. According to PicTar and Miranda algorithms, which predicted CDKN1A (p21) as a putative target of miR-17, a luciferase assay was performed and revealed that miR-17 directly targets the 3'-UTR of p21 mRNA. Indeed, p21 protein level was remarkably decreased by miR-17 overexpression in a p53-independent manner. It is noteworthy that miR-17 succeeded in suppressing doxorubicin-evoked higher expression of p21 and conferred the drug resistance. Meanwhile, introduction of anti-miR-17 in Fuji and HS-SYII cells significantly decreased cell growth, consistent with rescued expression of p21. Taken together, miR-17 promotes the tumor growth of synovial sarcomas by post-transcriptional suppression of p21, which may be amenable to innovative therapeutic targeting in synovial sarcoma.

24997345	Title	Downregulation of PPP2R5E expression by miR-23a suppresses apoptosis to facilitate the growth of gastric cancer cells.
24997345	Abstract	PPP2R5E belongs to the phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit B family and acts as a tumor suppressor in human cancer. However, the role of PPP2R5E in the tumorigenesis of gastric cancer is unclear. Here, we declare that PPP2R5E is downregulated by miR-23a and induces cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, ASO-miR-23a suppresses tumor growth derived from MGC803 cells in vivo. PPP2R5E is identified as a new target of miR-23a. Moreover, overexpression of PPP2R5E reversed the negative effects of miR-23a. We highlight the significance of miR-23a and PPP2R5E in the proliferation and apoptosis of gastric cancer cells.

25008064	Title	miR-129-1-3p inhibits cell migration by targeting BDKRB2 in gastric cancer.
25008064	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs, which regulate gene expression in the posttranscriptional level. They are involved in cancer occurrence and development. Different members of the same miRNA family may have different roles. Since the fact that metastasis is the main cause of cancer-related death and miR-129 has three members, in this study, we focused on the migration inhibitory role of miR-129-1-3p in gastric cancer and explored the possible mechanisms. We first compared the expression of three miR-129 family members, miR-129-5p, miR-129-1-3p, and miR-129-2-3p, between gastric carcinoma tissues and surgical margin non-cancer samples by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). Then, we selected miR-129-1-3p for further analysis and transfected its mimic and inhibitor into gastric cancer BGC-823 cells, respectively. Then, we compared the BGC-823 cells' migration capacity by transwell assay. Finally, we predicted the possible targets of miR-129-1-3p and selected one target for further analysis by QRT-PCR and luciferase reporter assay. The results showed that the expression of miR-129-1-3p in gastric carcinoma was significantly lower than that in surgical margin samples. And miR-129-1-3p could inhibit the migration of BGC-823 cells. From the candidates, we selected bradykinin receptor B2 (BDKRB2), which was reported relating to metastasis, as a target for further analysis. QRT-PCR showed that the expression of BDKRB2 was negatively related to miR-129-1-3p. Luciferase reporter assay showed that BDKRB2 was the target of the miR-129-1-3p. In summary, miR-129-1-3p inhibits the BGC-823 cell migration by targeting BDKRB2.

25015107	Title	TFF1 activates p53 through down-regulation of miR-504 in gastric cancer.
25015107	Abstract	The expression of TFF1 is frequently down-regulated in human gastric cancer whereas its knockout leads to the development of gastric adenomas and carcinomas in mouse models. The molecular mechanisms underlying the TFF1 tumor suppressor functions remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate, using colony formation assay and Annexin V staining, that reconstitution of TFF1 expression in gastric cancer cell models suppresses cell growth and promotes cell death. Furthermore, using a tumor xenograft mouse model of gastric cancer, we demonstrated that reconstitution of TFF1 suppresses tumor growth in vivo. The results from PG13-luciferase reporter assay and Western blot analysis indicated that TFF1 promotes the expression and transcription activity of p53 protein. Further analysis using cycloheximide-based protein assay and quantitative real-time PCR data suggested that TFF1 does not interfere with p53 mRNA levels or protein stability. Alternatively, we found that the reconstitution of TFF1 down-regulates miR-504, a negative regulator of p53. Western blot analysis data demonstrated that miR-504 abrogates TFF1-induced p53 protein expression and activity. In conclusion, the in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate, for the first time, a novel mechanism by which the tumor suppressor functions of TFF1 involve activation of p53 through down-regulation of miR-504.

25017365	Title	RKIP suppresses gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion and enhances apoptosis regulated by microRNA-224.
25017365	Abstract	The purposes of this study were to determine the expression profile of Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) in human gastric cancer cells and its effect on the biological characteristics of SGC-7901 cell lines, to examine the modulatory effect of microRNA-224 (miR-224) on RKIP. The research will provide novel strategies for gastric cancer treatment in the future. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed to determine the expression profile of RKIP in gastric cancer cell lines (SGC-7901, MGC80-3, and MKN45). A eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3.1-RKIP, was constructed and transfected into SGC-7901 cells. Changes in RKIP protein expression were examined by Western blot assays, and the effect of RKIP overexpression on SCG-7901 cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo(-z-y1)-3,5-diphenytetrazoliumromide (MTT) assays. The effect of RKIP overexpression on SGC-7901 cell proliferation and apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry and that on the migration of SGC-7901 cells was investigated by Transwell migration assays. RKIP was identified to be a regulatory target gene of miR-224 using a luciferase reporter gene system, and the effect of miR-224 on intracellular RKIP protein expression was examined by Western blot assays. The regulatory effect of miR-224 on the biological characteristics of RKIP was investigated by MTT, flow cytometry, and Transwell invasion chamber assays. The expression of RKIP in gastric cancer cells was decreased significantly in comparison to that of normal gastric mucosal epithelial cells (GES-1) (p < 0.01), as demonstrated by qRT-PCR assays. Compared with the control group, the up-regulation of RKIP intracellular expression was observed in SGC-7901 cells after transfection of pcDNA3.1-RKIP for 48 h (p < 0.01). There were significant decreases in cell viability and the S-phase fraction (p < 0.05), concomitant with a significant increase in apoptosis (p < 0.01), as well as a significant reduction in cells migrating through Transwell chambers (p < 0.05), as shown by MTT, flow cytometry, and Transwell invasion chamber assays. A significant decrease in luciferase activities in cells transfected with a miR-224 mimic was observed compared with that of the control group (p < 0.05), as suggested by the luciferase reporter gene system. As shown by Western blot assays, there was a significant decrease in RKIP expression in SGC-7901 cells transfected with the miR-224 mimic for 48 h compared with the control group (p < 0.05). As shown by MTT, flow cytometry, and Transwell invasion chamber assays, the changes in biological characteristics induced by RKIP overexpression could be suppressed in SGC-7901 cells after transfection of the miR-224 mimic. In conclusion, the down-regulation of RKIP expression was observed in human gastric cell lines, and miR-224 could negatively regulate the expression and biological characteristics of RKIP, contributing to suppress the proliferation and invasion of gastric cells.

25027343	Title	MiR-126 inhibits the invasion of gastric cancer cell in part by targeting Crk.
25027343	Abstract	Accumulating evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are aberrantly expressed in human gastric cancer and crucial to tumorigenesis. Herein, we identified the role of miR-126 in human gastric cancer (GC) growth and development in vitro. MiR-126 expression was investigated in GC tissue samples and cell lines by real-time PCR. Crystal violet test and Transwell assay were conducted to explore the effects of miR-126 on the proliferation and invasion of human GC cell lines, respectively. The impaction of miR-126 over expression on putative target Crk (v-crk sarcoma virus CT10 oncogene homolog) was subsequently confirmed via Western blot. Crk specific siRNA was used to suppress Crk expression. MiR-126 expression was frequently and markedly downregulated (p < 0.05) in human gastric cancer tissues. Overexpression of miR-126 inhibited GC cells invasion but did not affect its proliferation in vitro. Moreover, overexpression of miR-126 significantly decreased (p < 0.05) the protein levels of Crk, which has previously been identified as a direct target of miR-126. Knockdown of Crk also markedly suppressed GC cells invasion. Our results demonstrated that overexpression of miR-126 inhibited GC cells invasion in part by targeting Crk. These findings suggested that miR-126 played major roles in the malignant behavior of GC and it might be a promising therapeutic target of GC.

25041019	Title	MiR-421 regulates apoptosis of BGC-823 gastric cancer cells by targeting caspase-3.
25041019	Abstract	MicroRNAs might act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in cancer. Recent studies have shown that miR-421 is up-regulated in human gastric cancer. Here, we found that miR-421 was over-expressed in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. Bioinformatics analysis predicted that the caspase-3 gene was a target of miR-421. Caspase-3 was negatively regulated by miR-421 at the post-transcriptional level. Bax and Bcl-2 were also regulated by miR-421. Moreover, tumor necrosis factor receptor-I and -II, death receptors in the apoptosis pathway, were up-regulated by miR-421. The over-expression of miR-421 promoted gastric cancer cell growth and inhibited apoptosis of the BGC-823 gastric cancer cell line. These observations indicate that miR-421 acts as a tumor promoter by targeting the caspase-3 gene and preventing apoptosis of gastric cancer cells through inhibition of caspase-3 expression. These findings contribute to our understanding of the functions of miR-421 in gastric cancer.

25043310	Title	MicroRNA-25 promotes gastric cancer migration, invasion and proliferation by directly targeting transducer of ERBB2, 1 and correlates with poor survival.
25043310	Abstract	Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common tumors and the molecular mechanism underlying its metastasis is still largely unclear. Here, we show that miR-25 was overexpressed in plasma and primary tumor tissues of GC patients with tumor node metastasis stage (III or IV) or lymph node metastasis. MiR-25 inhibition significantly decreased the metastasis, invasion and proliferation of GC cells in vitro, and reduced their capacity to develop distal pulmonary metastases and peritoneal dissemination in vivo. Furthermore, miR-25 repressed transducer of ERBB2, 1 (TOB1) expression by directly binding to TOB1-3'-UTR, and the inverse correlation was observed between the expressions of miR-25 and TOB1 mRNA in primary GC tissues. Moreover, the loss of TOB1 increased the metastasis, invasion and proliferation of GC cells, and the restoration of TOB1 led to suppressed metastasis, invasion and proliferation. The receiver operating characteristics analysis yielded an area under the curve value of 0.7325 in distinguishing the GC patients with death from those with survival. The analysis of optimal cutoff value revealed poor survival in GC patients with high plasma concentrations of miR-25 (>0.2333 amol/Miul). Taken together, miR-25 promotes GC progression by directly downregulating TOB1 expression, and may be a noninvasive biomarker for the prognosis of GC patients.Oncogene advance online publication, 21 July 2014; doi:10.1038/onc.2014.214.

25055044	Title	Snail-regulated MiR-375 inhibits migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells by targeting JAK2.
25055044	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to play a critical role in cancer invasion and metastasis. Our previous study showed that miR-375 frequently downregulated in gastric cancer suppresses cell proliferation by targeting Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). Here, we further found that the expression level of miR-375 is significantly decreased in metastatic gastric cancer tissues compared with the non-metastasis controls. Ectopic expression of miR-375 inhibits the migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells partially by targeting JAK2. Furthermore, miR-375 expression is negatively regulated by the metastasis associated transcription factor Snail, which directly binds to the putative promoter of miR-375. Moreover, overexpression of Snail can partially reverse the inhibition of gastric cancer cell migration caused by miR-375. Taken together, these data suggest that miR-375 may be negatively regulated by Snail and involved in gastric cancer cell migration and invasion potentially by targeting JAK2.

25063221	Title	MicroRNA 520d-3p inhibits gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by downregulating EphA2 expression.
25063221	Abstract	Aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been shown to play important roles in cancer progression as a result of changes in expression of their target genes. In this study, we investigated the roles of miR-520d-3p on gastric cancer (GC) cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and confirmed that this miRNA regulates EphA2 expression. The mRNA expression levels of miR-520d-3p and EphA2 in GC tissues and cell lines were evaluated. The clinical and prognostic significance of miR-520d-3p was assessed. The biological function of miR-520d-3p in GC cells was investigated using a methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide assay, cell cycle assay, transwell invasion assay, and wound-healing assay. miR-520d-3p expression was down-regulated and inversely correlated with the expression of EphA2 in GC tissues and cell lines. Lower expression of miR-520d-3p was associated with tumor invasion (P = 0.0357), lymph nodes metastasis (P = 0.0272), a higher clinical stage (P = 0.0041), and poorer overall survival (P = 0.0105). Luciferase assays revealed that miR-520d-3p inhibited EphA2 expression by targeting the 3'-untranslated region of EphA2 mRNA. Overexpression of miR-520d-3p dramatically inhibited the proliferation, cell cycle progression, invasion, and migration of GC cells, while down-regulation substantially promoted these properties. Moreover, c-Myc, CyclinD1, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression levels were down-regulated in miR-520d-3p mimic-transfected cells and up-regulated in miR-520d-3p inhibitor-transfected cells. Taken together, our data showed that miR-520d-3p appears to contribute to GC progression via the regulation of EphA2 and could serve as a novel prognostic and potential therapeutic marker.

25080937	Title	SRF expedites metastasis and modulates the epithelial to mesenchymal transition by regulating miR-199a-5p expression in human gastric cancer.
25080937	Abstract	Dysregulation of transcription factors (TFs) is associated with tumor progression, but little is known about TF expression patterns in the context of gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. Using array-based profile analysis, we found that 22 TFs showed differential activities between GC cell lines with low- and high-metastatic potential. Of this group of TFs, serum response factor (SRF) was significantly upregulated in metastatic GC cells. SRF expression was frequently elevated in a panel of metastatic GC cells and tissues, and high-level expression of SRF was significantly associated with a more aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis in patients with GC. In GC cell lines, overexpression of SRF potently promoted cell migration and invasion in vitro as well as the formation of intrahepatic and pulmonary metastases in vivo, whereas loss of SRF inhibited GC cell invasion and metastasis. We also performed a microRNA microarray to screen for transcriptional targets of SRF and found that SRF transactivates miR-199a-5p and miR-199a-3p by directly binding to their promoters. We further determined that overexpression of miR-199a-5p, but not miR-199a-3p, increased GC cell invasion and metastasis. In contrast, inhibition of miR-199a-5p impaired the metastatic potential of GC cells in vitro and in vivo, and E-cadherin was identified as a direct and functional target of miR-199a-5p in GC cells. Specifically, our results showed that SRF promotes GC metastasis and the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) though miR-199a-5p-mediated downregulation of E-cadherin. The present study thus provides insight into the specific biological behavior of SRF in GC metastasis. As increased activity of the SRF/miR-199a-5p/E-cadherin pathway appears to promote GC cell EMT and metastasis, these regulators may therefore be developed as therapeutic targets or biomarkers for GC progression.

25095974	Title	MicroRNA-92 promotes gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion through targeting FXR.
25095974	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small noncoding RNAs, play critical roles in human carcinogenesis through downregulation of various target genes. In the present study, we found that miR-92 is upregulated in gastric cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Interestingly, miR-92 expression is significantly associated with clinical characteristics of patients. Gain or loss-of-function in vitro experiments further show that miR-92 mimics significantly promoted, while its antisense oligos inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion. Moreover, luciferase reporter assays and western blot indicated that farnesoid X receptor (FXR), is a direct target of miR-92. Therefore, our data suggest that upregulation of miR-92 may represent an important mechanism for the development of gastric cancer.

25095979	Title	Upregulation of miR-513b inhibits cell proliferation, migration, and promotes apoptosis by targeting high mobility group-box 3 protein in gastric cancer.
25095979	Abstract	The high mobility group-box 3 (HMGB3) protein belongs to the high mobility group box (HMG-box) subfamily, and recent studies have shown that HMGB3 is an oncogene for leukemia. HMGB3 is also expressed at a high level in the progression phase of breast and gastric cancer (GC). Using bioinformatic analyses, we found that HMGB3 is a potential target for miR-513b. However, the pathophysiological role of miR-513b and its relevance to the growth and development of GC have yet to be investigated. This study focuses on whether miR-513b acts as a tumor suppressor in GC. Compared with non-malignant adjacent tissues samples, qRT-PCR data showed significant downregulation of miR-513b in 74 GC tissue samples (P < 0.01). Furthermore, western blotting revealed that HMGB3 protein was overexpressed in tumor samples relative to matched, non-malignant adjacent tissues. Western blotting and qRT-PCR results showed that high expression of HMGB3 and low expression of miR-513b were both significantly associated with primary tumors, lymph node metastases, and the clinical stage (P < 0.01). MiR-513b was shown to not only inhibit the proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells (MKN45 and SGC7901) in the CCK-8 and transwell assays, but also to promote cell apoptosis in a flow-cytometric apoptosis assay. In western blot and luciferase assays, HMGB3 was identified as a major target of miR-513b. Moreover, we also found that the expression of HMGB3 lacking in 3' UTR could abrogate the anti-migration and pro-apoptosis function of miR-513b. These findings suggest the importance of miR-513b targeting of HMGB3 in the regulation of growth, migration and apoptosis of GC, improve our understanding of the mechanisms of GC pathogenesis, and may promote the development of novel targeted therapies.

25111461	Title	miR-129-1-3p promote BGC-823 cell proliferation by targeting PDCD2.
25111461	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are the class of small noncoding RNAs, and play an important role in the regulation of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. In this study, we explored the effect of miR-129-1-3p on the growth and cell cycle of human gastric cancer cell line BGC-823. The miR-129-1-3p mimics or inhibitors were transfected into the BGC-823 cell line, and the cell cycle and cell growth was measured by flow cytometry and real-time cell analyzer, respectively. The possible targets of miR-129-1-3p were analyzed by quantitative real time-PCR (QRT-PCR), Western blotting and Luciferase reporter assay. The results showed that miR-129-1-3p could promote the growth and cell cycle of BGC-823 cells. Although protein expression of programmed cell death 2 (PDCD2) was not changed with miR-129-1-3p, QRT-PCR showed that expression of PDCD2 mRNA was negatively related to the miR-129-1-3p. Luciferase reporter assay revealed that PDCD2 is one of the targets of miR-129-1-3p. Our results indicated that miR-129-1-3p might promote proliferation of BGC-823 cells by targeting PDCD2.

25115392	Title	F-box protein FBXO31 is down-regulated in gastric cancer and negatively regulated by miR-17 and miR-20a.
25115392	Abstract	FBXO31, a subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligase, played a crucial role in neuronal development, DNA damage response and tumorigenesis. Here, we investigated the expression and prognosis value of FBXO31 in human primary gastric cancer (GC) samples. Meanwhile, the biological role and the regulation mechanism of FBXO31 were evaluated. We found that FBXO31 mRNA and protein was decreased dramatically in the GC tissue compared with the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. FBXO31 expression was significantly associated with tumor size, tumor infiltration, clinical grade and patients' prognosis. FBXO31 overexpression significantly decreased colony formation and induced a G1-phase arrest and inhibited the expression of CyclinD1 protein in GC cells. Further evidence was obtained from knockdown of FBXO31. Ectopic expression of FBXO31 dramatically inhibited xenograft tumor growth in nude mice. miR-20a and miR-17 mimics inhibited, whereas the inhibitor of miR-20a and miR-17 increased, the expression of FBXO31, respectively. miR-20a and miR-17 directly bind to the 3'-UTR of FBXO31. The level of miR-20a and miR-17 in GC tissue was significantly higher than that in surrounding normal mucosa. Moreover, a highly significant negative correlation between miR-20a (miR-17) and FBXO31 was observed in these GC samples. Therefore, effective therapy targeting the miR-20a (miR-17)-FBXO31-CyclinD1 pathway may help control GC progression.

25119599	Title	miR-152 suppresses gastric cancer cell proliferation and motility by targeting CD151.
25119599	Abstract	We aimed to study the post-translational regulation of CD151 by the microRNA miR-152. CD151 is highly expressed in gastric cancer (GC) and has been shown to accelerate GC by enhancing invasion and metastasis; however, its regulation is still unclear. Our results showed decreased expression of miR-152 in GC tissue samples and cell lines. In addition, miR-152 complementation significantly inhibits both the proliferation and motility of GC cells. CD151 was found to be a target of miR-152, and overexpression of CD151 attenuated the suppressive effect of miR-152. Our findings highlight an essential role of miR-152 in the regulation of proliferation and motility of GC cells and suggest a potential application of miR-152 in GC treatment.

25136862	Title	MicroRNA-410 suppresses migration and invasion by targeting MDM2 in gastric cancer.
25136862	Abstract	Gastric cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies in tumors in the East Asian countries. Identifying precise prognostic markers and effective therapeutic targets is important in the treatment of gastric cancer. microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms by which miRNAs regulate gastric cancer metastasis remain poorly understood. In this study, we found that the levels of miR-410 in gastric cancer and cell lines were much lower than that in the normal control, respectively, and the lower level of miR-410 was significantly associated with lymph-node metastasis. Transfection of miR-410 mimics could significantly inhibit the cell proliferation, migration and invasion in the HGC-27 gastric cancer cell lines. In contrast, knockdown of miR-410 had the opposite effect on the cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Moreover, we also found that MDM2 was negatively regulated by miR-410 at the post-transcriptional level, via a specific target site with the 3'UTR by luciferase reporter assay. The expression of MDM2 was inversely correlated with miR-410 expression in gastric cancer tissues, and overexpression of MDM2 in miR-410-transfected gastric cancer cells effectively rescued the inhibition of cell proliferation and invasion caused by miR-410. Thus, our findings suggested that miR-410 acted as a new tumor suppressor by targeting the MDM2 gene and inhibiting gastric cancer cells proliferation, migration and invasion. The findings of this study contributed to the current understanding of these functions of miR-410 in gastric cancer.

25152372	Title	miR-133 is a key negative regulator of CDC42-PAK pathway in gastric cancer.
25152372	Abstract	Cell division cycle 42 (CDC42), an important member of the Ras homolog (Rho) family, plays a key role in regulating multiple cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, migration, cell cytoskeleton organization, cell fate determination and differentiation. Among the downstream effectors of CDC42, P21-activated kinases (PAKs) obtain the most attention. Although a large body of evidence indicates that CDC42/PAKs pathway plays important role in tumor growth, invasion and metastasis, the mechanism of their negative regulation remains unclear. Here, we identified CDC42, a PAKs activating factor, was a target of miR-133. Ectopic overexpression of miRNAs not only downregulated CDC42 expression and PAKs activation, but also inhibited cancer cell proliferation and migration. We also found that miR-133 was down-regulated in 180 pairs gastric cancer tissues. miR-133 expression was negatively associated with tumor size, invasion depth and peripheral organ metastasis. Besides, dysfunction of miR-133 was an independent prognosis factor for overall survival. Our findings could provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms of gastric carcinogenesis, and may help facilitating development of CDC42/PAK-based therapies for human cancer.

25159729	Title	The sensitivity of gastric cancer to trastuzumab is regulated by the miR-223/FBXW7 pathway.
25159729	Abstract	A recent large-scale phase III study (the ToGA trial) demonstrated the significant efficacy of trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive gastric cancer. Although trastuzumab has become a key drug in cancer treatment, the resistance of breast cancer to trastuzumab is a major problem in clinical practice. However, it is unclear whether similar mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance are involved in gastric cancer (GC). The aim of the current study was to identify a novel micro-RNA (miR)/gene pathway that regulates the sensitivity of HER2-positive GC cells to trastuzumab. We focused on F-box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBXW7), which is one of the major causes of drug resistance. We also identified miR-223, which can regulate FBXW7, using miR quantitative reverse transcription-PCR array analysis using by resistance cell line, which we established. Overexpression of miR-223 decreased FBXW7 expression and the sensitivity of GC cells to trastuzumab, while suppression of miR-223 restored FBXW7 expression and the sensitivity of GC cells to trastuzumab. Moreover, overexpression of miR-223 significantly suppressed trastuzumab-induced apoptosis. This study is the first report to reveal that the miR-223/FBXW7 pathway regulates the sensitivity of a HER2-positive GC cell line to trastuzumab through the modulation of apoptosis. These findings suggest that this pathway can be crucial for the mechanism of trastuzumab resistance in GC, which may lead to the development of individualized treatment in clinical practice.

25163571	Title	MicroRNA-107 promotes proliferation of gastric cancer cells by targeting cyclin dependent kinase 8.
25163571	Abstract	The biological processes and molecular mechanisms underlying miR-107 remain unclear in gastric cancer(GC). In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression, biological functions and mechanisms of miR-107 in GC. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was used to test miR-107 expression. MTT and colony formation assays were conducted to explore the potential function of miR-107 in human GC cell line SGC7901. The target gene was determined by bioinformatic algorithms, dual luciferase reporter assay, RT-PCR and Western blot. Expression of miR-107 was significantly elevated in GC cell line than that in gastric epithelial cell line(p = 0.012). We found that miR-107 inhibitor transfection significantly decreased the proliferation of GC cell line, and clone formation rate of miR-107 inhibitor transfected group was significantly lower than that of control group. Luciferase assays using a reporter carrying a putative miR-107 target site in the 3'untranslated region (3'-UTR) of cyclin dependent kinase 8 (CDK8) revealed that miR-107 directly targets CDK8. The expression level of CDK8 mRNA and protein in miR-107 inhibitor transfected GC cell line was significantly decreased compared with control group. Our findings indicate that miR-107 is upregulated in GC and affects the proliferation of GC cells, partially through the regulation of CDK8.

25169484	Title	miR-124 inhibits growth and invasion of gastric cancer by targeting ROCK1.
25169484	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as critical regulators of genes involved in many biological processes. Aberrant alteration of miRNAs have been found in many cancers, including gastric cancer (GC), but the molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Herein, we investigated the role of miR-124 in GC. We found that its expression was significantly reduced in both GC tissue samples and cell lines. Forced expression of miR-124 suppressed GC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, the Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK1) was identified as a direct target of miR-124 in GC cells. Finally, silencing of ROCK1 showed similar effects as miR-124 overexpression, while supplementation of ROCK1 remarkably restored the cell growth and invasion inhibited by miR-124. Together, our data demonstrate that miR-124 acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting ROCK1, and posit miR-124 as a novel strategy for GC treatment.

25170877	Title	miR-30b, down-regulated in gastric cancer, promotes apoptosis and suppresses tumor growth by targeting plasminogen activator inhibitor-1.
25170877	Abstract	Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignant diseases worldwide. Emerging evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with tumor development and progression. Our previous studies have revealed that H. pylori infection was able to induce the altered expression of miR-30b in gastric epithelial cells. However, little is known about the potential role of miR-30b in gastric cancer. We analyzed the expression of miR-30b in gastric cancer cell lines and human gastric cancer tissues. We examined the effect of miR-30b mimics on the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells in vitro by flow cytometry (FCM) and caspase-3/7 activity assays. Nude mouse xenograft model was used to determine whether miR-30b is involved in tumorigenesis of gastric cancer. The target of miR-30b was identified by bioinformatics analysis, luciferase assay and Western blot. Finally, we performed the correlation analysis between miR-30b and its target expression in gastric cancer. miR-30b was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer cells and human gastric cancer tissues. Enforced expression of miR-30b promoted the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells in vitro, and miR-30b could significantly inhibit tumorigenicity of gastric cancer by increasing the apoptosis proportion of cancer cells in vivo. Moreover, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was identified as the potential target of miR-30b, and miR-30b level was inversely correlated with PAI-1 expression in gastric cancer. In addition, silencing of PAI-1 was able to phenocopy the effect of miR-30b overexpression on apoptosis regulation of cancer cells, and overexpression of PAI-1 could suppressed the effect of promoting cell apoptosis by miR-30b, indicating PAI-1 is potentially involved in miR-30b-induced apoptosis on cancer cells. miR-30b may function as a novel tumor suppressor gene in gastric cancer by targeting PAI-1 and regulating the apoptosis of cancer cells. miR-30b could serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target against gastric cancer.

25174799	Title	MicroRNA-645, up-regulated in human adencarcinoma of gastric esophageal junction, inhibits apoptosis by targeting tumor suppressor IFIT2.
25174799	Abstract	An increasing body of evidence indicates that miRNAs have a critical role in carcinogenesis and cancer progression; however, the role of miRNAs in the tumorigenesis of adencarcinoma of gastric esophageal junction (AGEJ) remains largely unclear. The SGC7901 and BGC-823 gastric cancer cell lines were used. The expressions of miR-645 and IFIT2 (Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2) were examined by qRT-PCR, The expressions of IFIT2 was examined by western blotting and immunohistochemistry assay. The cell apoptosis was determined by FACS. MiR-645 inhibitor, mimics and plasmid-IFIT2 transfections were performed to study the loss- and gain-function. Caspase-3/7 activity was examined by caspase-3/7 assay. In the present study, we have reported an increased expression of miR-645 in AGEJ clinical specimens compared with paired non-cancerous tissues. We also observed a significant miR-645 up-regulation in two gastric cancer (GC) cell lines, SGC7901 and BGC-823, which were used as cell models because there was no available AGEJ cell lines established to date. We found that inhibition of miR-645 could sensitize dramatically SGC7901 and BGC-823 cells to both serum starvation- and chemotherapeutic drug-induced apoptosis by up-regulating IFIT2, a mediator of apoptosis via a mitochondrial pathway, with a potential binding site for miR-645 in its mRNA's 3'UTR. Further investigation exhibited that IFIT2 expression decreases in SGC7901 and BGC-823 cells and AGEJ tissues. IFIT2 ectopic expression leads to promotion of cell apoptosis, indicating that IFIT2 may function as a suppressor in the development of AGEJ. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-645 induces up-regulation of IFIT2 and increased caspase-3/7 activity compared with control groups. Our data suggest that miR-645 functions as an oncogene in human AGEJ by, at least partially through, targeting IFIT2.

25187177	Title	Epigenetic silencing of miR-210 increases the proliferation of gastric epithelium during chronic Helicobacter pylori infection.
25187177	Abstract	Persistent colonization of the gastric mucosa by Helicobacter pylori (Hp) elicits chronic inflammation and aberrant epithelial cell proliferation, which increases the risk of gastric cancer. Here we examine the ability of microRNAs to modulate gastric cell proliferation in response to persistent Hp infection and find that epigenetic silencing of miR-210 plays a key role in gastric disease progression. Importantly, DNA methylation of the miR-210 gene is increased in Hp-positive human gastric biopsies as compared with Hp-negative controls. Moreover, silencing of miR-210 in gastric epithelial cells promotes proliferation. We identify STMN1 and DIMT1 as miR-210 target genes and demonstrate that inhibition of miR-210 expression augments cell proliferation by activating STMN1 and DIMT1. Together, our results highlight inflammation-induced epigenetic silencing of miR-210 as a mechanism of induction of chronic gastric diseases, including cancer, during Hp infection.

25202363	Title	miR-449a and CDK6 in gastric carcinoma.
25202363	Abstract	The present study aimed to identify the association between microRNA (miR/miRNA)-449a, the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)6 protein and gastric carcinoma, and discuss the effect of miR-449a on the expression of the CDK6 protein. Quantitative (q)PCR and western blot analysis were used to analyze the expression of the miR-449a and the CDK6 protein in gastric carcinoma and tumor-adjacent normal tissues. The real-time cell analyzer and the DAPI staining test were used to monitor the different miR-449a levels regulating the proliferation and apoptosis of the MGC-803 cell line. Immunofluorescence and western blot analyses were used to detect the expression level of the CDK6 protein in the cells of the miR-449a upregulation and downregulation groups, and a control group. A scratch test was used to study the effects of miR-449a expression on migration and invasion. It was found that the expression of miR-449a was downregulated and the expression of CDK6 protein was upregulated in gastric carcinoma tissue. The level of MGC-803 cell proliferation was decreased and the apoptosis level was increased by the upregulation of miR-449a expression, and the opposite effect was shown by the downregulation of expression. The expression of the CDK6 protein in the MGC-803 cells was downregulated by upregulating the expression of miR-449a. The distance of the scratch was shortened markedly after 12 h by downregulating the expression of miR-449a in the MGC-803 cells. The present study identified that a lower expression level of miR-449 and a higher expression level of CDK6 may contribute to the occurrence and development of gastric cancer. Furthermore, it was shown that miR-449a is able to regulate the expression of the CDK6 protein.

25231560	Title	Reduced miR-125a-5p expression is associated with gastric carcinogenesis through the targeting of E2F3.
25231560	Abstract	Emerging evidence suggests that altered expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is involved in cancer progression. However, the role of miR-125a-5p in gastric carcinogenesis remains unknown. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that the expression of miR-125a-5p was significantly decreased in >80% of gastric cancer tissues compared with their adjacent non-tumor tissues, and was markedly reduced in ~95% of intestinal-type gastric cancer tissues. The downregulated miR-125a-5p was significantly associated with gastric cancer metastasis. Ectopic expression of miR-125a-5p substantially inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion activities of gastric cancer cells. Furthermore, forced expression of miR-125a-5p repressed the activity of a luciferase reporter carrying the 3'-untranslated (3'-UTR) region of E2F3, which was eliminated by mutation of the predicted miR-125a-binding site, indicating that E2F3 may be a potential target gene of miR-125a-5p. These data suggest that by targeting E2F3, miR-125a-5p may be important as a potential tumor suppressor gene in gastric carcinogenesis.

25240408	Title	MiR-125b promotes cell migration and invasion by targeting PPP1CA-Rb signal pathways in gastric cancer, resulting in a poor prognosis.
25240408	Abstract	MiR-125b functions as an oncogene in many cancers; however, its clinical significance and molecular mechanism in gastric cancers have never been sufficiently investigated. Here, we elucidated the functions and molecular regulated pathways of MiR-125b in gastric cancer. We investigated MiR-125b expression in fresh tissues from 50 gastric cancer patients and 6 gastric cancer cell lines using RT-PCR, and explored its prognostic value by hybridizing MiR-125b in situ for 300 clinical gastric tumor tissues with pathological diagnosis and clinical parameters. The effects of MiR-125b on gastric cancer cells and downstream target genes and proteins were analyzed by MTT, transwell assay, RT-PCR, and western blot on the basis of silencing MiR-125b in vitro. Luciferase reporter plasmid was constructed to demonstrate MiR-125b's direct target. MiR-125b was upregulated in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines, and significantly promoted cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion by downregulating the expression of PPP1CA and upregulating Rb phosphorylation. MiR-125b expression was significantly correlated with tumor size and depth of invasion, lymph nodes, distant metastasis, and TNM stage. The high-MiR-125b-expression group had a significantly poorer prognosis than the low-expression group (P < 0.05) in stages I, II, and III, and the 5-year survival rate in of the high-expression group was significantly lower than that of the low-expression group. MiR-125b functions as an oncogene by targeting downregulated PPP1CA and upregulated Rb phosphorylation in gastric cancer. MiR-125b not only promotes cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, but also acts as an independent prognostic factor in gastric cancer.

25253336	Title	Latency-associated viral interleukin-10 (IL-10) encoded by human cytomegalovirus modulates cellular IL-10 and CCL8 Secretion during latent infection through changes in the cellular microRNA hsa-miR-92a.
25253336	Abstract	The UL111A gene of human cytomegalovirus encodes a viral homologue of the cellular immunomodulatory cytokine interleukin 10 (cIL-10), which, due to alternative splicing, results in expression of two isoforms designated LAcmvIL-10 (expressed during both lytic and latent infection) and cmvIL-10 (identified only during lytic infection). We have analyzed the functions of LAcmvIL-10 during latent infection of primary myeloid progenitor cells and found that LAcmvIL-10 is responsible, at least in part, for the known increase in secretion of cellular IL-10 and CCL8 in the secretomes of latently infected cells. This latency-associated increase in CCL8 expression results from a concomitant LAcmvIL-10-mediated suppression of the expression of the cellular microRNA (miRNA) hsa-miR-92a, which targets CCL8 directly. Taking the data together, we show that the previously observed downregulation of hsa-miR-92a and upregulation of CCL8 during HCMV latent infection of myeloid cells are intimately linked via the latency-associated expression of LAcmvIL-10. HCMV latency causes significant morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised individuals, yet HCMV is carried silently (latently) in 50 to 90% of the population. Understanding how HCMV maintains infection for the lifetime of an infected individual is critical for the treatment of immunocompromised individuals suffering with disease as a result of HCMV. In this study, we analyze one of the proteins that are expressed during the "latent" phase of HCMV, LAcmvIL-10, and find that the expression of the gene modulates the microenvironment of the infected cell, leading to evasion of the immune system.

25270520	Title	MicroRNA-200 family members and ZEB2 are associated with brain metastasis in gastric adenocarcinoma.
25270520	Abstract	Although the incidence of brain metastasis in gastric cancer is relatively low, its prevalence may increase with improved therapy and longer survival tumors. The molecular mechanisms underlying brain metastases are not well understood. To gain insight into the mechanism of brain metastasis, we studied differences in microRNA (miRNA) expression levels in 8 cases of matched primary gastric adenocarcinoma and brain metastatic adenocarcinoma using the Illumina microRNA microarray chip. We identified 6 upregulated and 2 downregulated miRNAs in all 8 cases simultaneously. Interestingly, 2 out of 8 miRNAs (hsa-miR‑141-3p and hsa-miR-200b-3p) belonged to the miR-200 family. Online microRNA database searching revealed that ZEB2 is the top-ranked target gene for hsa-miR141-3p and hsa-miR-200b-3p, prompting us to focus ZEB2 expression in brain metastatic adenocarcinoma. We confirmed that ZEB2 expression was markedly downregulated in some brain metastatic samples. In addition, decreased ZEB2 expression was noted by western blot analysis of 2 metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma cell types that were derived by in vivo selection following intracardiac injection of gastric cancer cell lines. In conclusion, we demonstrate that expression of miRNA-200 family members and ZEB2 are associated with brain metastases of gastric adenocarcinoma, not only in matched patient samples, but also in metastatic cell lines that were derived by in vivo selection.

25286029	Title	miR-106b modulates cancer stem cell characteristics through TGF-Beta/Smad signaling in CD44-positive gastric cancer cells.
25286029	Abstract	Cancer stem cells have the capacity to form new tumors and are thus considered to be a cause of metastasis and tumor recurrence. However, many of the mechanisms determining cancer stem cell characteristics are still unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are possible modulators of cancer stem cell generation and may be involved in the retention of cancer stem cell characteristics. The aim of this study was to examine the miRNA expression profiles regulating the cancer stem-like cell characteristics in gastric cancer. We sorted gastric cancer stem-like cells using the stem cell marker CD44 by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. CD44(+) cells formed more and larger spheres compared with CD44(-) cells. Cancer stem cell markers were overexpressed in CD44(+) cells. CD44(+) cells showed increased expression of mesenchymal cell markers, whereas epithelial markers were downregulated. In miRNA microarray, the miR-106b family comprising miR-106b, miR-93, and miR-25 was significantly upregulated in CD44(+) cells than in CD44(-) cells. Smad7, which inhibits transforming growth factor-Beta (TGF-Beta)/Smad signaling as a target of the miR-106b family, was downregulated in CD44(+) cells. Furthermore, expression of TGF-Beta/Smad signal molecules was activated in CD44(+) cells, in accordance with the action of the miR-106b family. Inhibition of miR-106b showed suppression of the TGF-Beta/Smad signaling pathway and decreased self-renewal capacity and cell invasiveness. Our study suggests that CD44(+) gastric cancer cells show cancer stem cell properties with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Increased miR-106b family expression regulated cancer stem-like cell properties, particularly EMT characteristics, through the TGF-Beta/Smad signaling pathway in CD44(+) stem-like cells. Taken together, these results indicate that targeting miR-106b may be an effective form of cancer therapy in gastric cancer through the modulation of cancer stem cell characteristics.

25295122	Title	MicroRNA-183 inhibits gastric cancer proliferation and invasion via directly targeting Bmi-1.
25295122	Abstract	The aberrant expression of microRNA-183 (miRNA/miR-183) has been found to be involved in numerous tumor types. However, the role of miR-183 in gastric cancer pathology is unclear and requires investigation. In the present study, the miR-183 expression levels of gastric cancer cell lines and tissues obtained from gastric cancer patients were measured by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. The effect of miR-183 on gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion was evaluated using MTT, colony formation and Transwell assays. The target of miR-183 was identified and confirmed using a luciferase activity assay. The results revealed that miR-183 was significantly downregulated in gastric cancer cells compared with GES-1 normal gastric epithelial cells. In addition, miR-183 was reduced in gastric cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. The ectopic expression of miR-183 significantly inhibited gastric cancer cell proliferation, colony formation and invasion. Bmi-1 was also confirmed as a downstream target of miR-183 in the gastric cancer cells by western blot analysis and luciferase activity assays. In conclusion, miR-183 is downregulated in gastric cancer cells and tissues, and inhibits gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion by targeting Bmi-1. Therefore, targeting miR-183 may be a potential therapeutic strategy in gastric cancer patients.

25307786	Title	A MDM2-dependent positive-feedback loop is involved in inhibition of miR-375 and miR-106b induced by Helicobacter pylori lipopolysaccharide.
25307786	Abstract	Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been linked to virulence factors of Helicobacter pylori and shown to contribute to the progression of gastric cancer. However, the mechanisms of these processes remain poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms by which lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a virulence factor of H. pylori, regulates miR-375 and miR-106b expression in gastric epithelial cells. The results show that LPS from H. pylori 26695 downregulated the expression of miR-375 and miR-106b in gastric epithelial cells, and low levels of Dicer were also observed. Downregulation of miR-375 was found to increase expression of MDM2 with SP1 activation. Overexpression of MDM2 inhibited Dicer by repressing p63 to create a positive-feedback loop involving SP1/MDM2/p63/Dicer that leads to inhibition of miR-375 and miR-106b expression. In addition, we demonstrated that JAK1 and STAT3 were downstream target genes of miR-106b. H. pylori LPS also enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2 and STAT3. Together, these results provide insight into the regulatory mechanisms of MDM2 on H. pylori LPS-induced specific miRNAs, and furthermore, suggest that gastric epithelial cells treated with H. pylori LPS may be susceptible to JAK/STAT3 signal pathway activation via inhibition of miR-375 and miR-106b.

25323629	Title	microRNA-22 acts as a metastasis suppressor by targeting metadherin in gastric cancer.
25323629	Abstract	microRNA (miR)-22 has been reported to be downregulated in hepatocellular, lung, colorectal, ovarian and breast cancer, acting as a tumor suppressor. The present study investigated the potential effects of miR-22 on gastric cancer invasion and metastasis and the molecular mechanism. miR-22 expression was examined in tumor tissues of in 89 gastric cancer patients by in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis. Additionally, the association between miR-22 levels and clinicopathological parameters was analyzed. A luciferase assay was conducted for target identification. The ability of invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo was evaluated by cell migration and invasion assays and in a xenograft model. The results showed that miR-22 was downregulated in the gastric cancer specimens and significantly correlated with the advanced clinical stage and lymph node metastasis. In addition, metadherin (MTDH) was shown to be a direct target of miR-22 and the expression of MTDH was inversely correlated with miR-22 expression in gastric cancer. Ectopic expression of miR-22 suppressed cell invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. The present study suggested that miR-22 may be a valuable prognostic factor in gastric cancer. miR-22 inhibited gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis by directly targeting MTDH. The novel miR-22/MTDH link confirmed in the present study provided a novel, potential therapeutic target for the treatment of gastric cancer.

25337200	Title	miR-183 inhibits invasion of gastric cancer by targeting Ezrin.
25337200	Abstract	miR-183, a member of an evolutionarily conserved miRNA cluster (miR-96, miR-182, and miR-183), has been demonstrated to act as both a tumor suppressor and oncogene in various type of human cancer. However, the biological role of miR-183 in gastric cancer (GC) still remains unclear. In the present study, miR-183 expression was significantly decreased in gastric cancer tissues compared with its' adjacent normal tissues, and down-regulation of miR-183 was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and pathological TNM stage. Furthermore, Erzin, which was reported to be up-regulated in gastric cancer, was identified as an efficient target of miR-183. Overexpression of miR-183 markedly suppressed cells invasion by downregulation of Ezrin expression. However, miR-183 expression didn't affect cells proliferation and cell cycle distribution of GC. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that miR-183 acts as a tumor suppressor in GC, partially at least via regulation of Ezrin. Therefore, miR-183 may be a potential target for the treatment of gastric cancer.

25342326	Title	MicroRNA library-based functional screening identified miR-137 as a suppresser of gastric cancer cell proliferation.
25342326	Abstract	Uncontrolled proliferation is a key characteristic of gastric carcinogenesis and the precise mechanisms underlying the altered proliferation behaviors of GC cells have not been clearly elucidated. miRNAs has been suggested to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis and development of various cancers. In the present study, we employed an impedance-based real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) system to detect the effects of ectopically expressed miRNAs on GC cell proliferation. miRNA mimics were transfected into gastric cancer cell line SGC7901 and the effect of individual miRNA on the proliferation rate of the cells was measured by the RT-CES system. The screening results were validated with qRT-PCR and miR-137 was selected for further research. The effects of ectopically expressed miR-137 on GC cell growth and cell cycle progress were measured using MTT assay and flow cytometry. The target gene of miR-137 was predicted using different bioinformatics tools and the direct interaction between miR-137 and the 3'-UTR was confirmed with a luciferase reporter assay. The in vivo effect of miR-137 on GC cell proliferation was examined with a tumor-bearing nude mouse model. The correlation between miR-137 expression and patients' prognosis was explored in a cohort of 38 patients. Prognosis was explored in a cohort of 38 patients. Ectopic expression of miR-137 was sufficient to inhibit GC cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatics prediction and luciferase reporter assay revealed CDK6 as a target gene through which miR-137 exerted an inhibitory function. Moreover, miR-137 expression positively correlated with better prognosis. Our data indicated an important regulatory role of miR-137 in GC cell proliferation and that it may be explored as a prognostic marker for GC.

25344911	Title	Methylation of miR-129-5p CpG island modulates multi-drug resistance in gastric cancer by targeting ABC transporters.
25344911	Abstract	Recent studies have reported that hyper-methylation in the promoter region of miRNAs could silence the expression of tumor suppressive miRNAs and might play significant roles in the process of tumor development. However, the potential mechanisms regarding how methylation of miRNA CpG Island could regulate cancer cell chemo-resistance have not yet been studied. Using microarray and BSP (Bisulfate Sequencing PCR) assays, we found that compared with the parent SGC7901/VCR cells, expression of miR-129-5p was restored in SGC7901/VCR gastric cancer multi-drug resistant cell line treated by de-methylation reagent (5-AZA-dC). Using gain or loss of function assays, we found the over-expressed miR-129-5p reduced the chemo-resistance of SGC7901/VCR and SGC7901/ADR cells, while down-regulation of miR-129-5p had an opposite effect. Furthermore, three members of multi-drug resistance (MDR) related ABC transporters (ABCB1, ABCC5 and ABCG1) were found to be direct targets of miR-129-5p using bioinformatics analysis and report gene assays. The present study indicated that hyper-methylation of miR-129-5p CpG island might play important roles in the development of gastric cancer chemo-resistance by targeting MDR related ABC transporters and might be used as a potential therapeutic target in preventing the chemo-resistance of gastric cancer.

25356105	Title	MicroRNA-183 inhibits apoptosis and promotes proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells by targeting PDCD4.
25356105	Abstract	MicroRNA plays an important role in multiple processes of cancer development. Aberrant expression of miR-183 has been frequently reported in a variety of cancer types; however, the roles and mechanisms of miR-183 in gastric cancer are largely unknown. Here, we report that miR-183 is significantly up-regulated in human gastric tumor tissues compared to the adjacent normal tissues. Up-regulation of miR-183 is associated with advanced clinical stage, positive lymph node, deep stromal invasion, and distant metastasis in gastric cancer patients. We further demonstrated that miR-183 promotes gastric cancer cell growth in vitro by inhibition of apoptosis. Moreover, overexpression of miR-183 enhances gastric cancer cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-183 decreased, and inhibition of miR-183 increased the expression of PDCD4, a tumor suppressor, at both mRNA and protein levels. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-183 may modulate progression and metastatic potential of gastric cancer through inhibition of PDCD4 expression. miR-183 could serve as a potential biomarker for gastric cancer progression and a novel therapeutic target for gastric cancer treatment.

25373785	Title	Down-regulation of miR-203 induced by Helicobacter pylori infection promotes the proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer by targeting CASK.
25373785	Abstract	Several microRNAs (miRNA) have been implicated in H. pylori related gastric cancer (GC). However, the molecular mechanism of miRNAs in GC has not been fully understood. In this study, we reported that miR-203 is significantly down-regulated in H. pylori positive tissues and cells and in tumor tissues with important functional consequences. Ectopic expression of miR-203 dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and invasion. We found that miR-203 strongly reduced the expression of CASK oncogene in GC cells. Similar to the restoring miR-203 expression, CASK down-regulation inhibited cell growth and invasion, whereas CASK over-expression rescued the suppressive effect of miR-203. These results can also be found in nude mice. In clinical specimens, CASK was over-expressed in tumors and H. pylori positive tissues and its mRNA levels were inversely correlated with miR-203 expression. Taken together, our results indicated that miR-203 functions as a growth-suppressive miRNA in H. pylori related GC, and that its suppressive effects are mediated mainly by repressing CASK expression.

25394359	Title	Emerging role of microRNAs in modulating endothelin-1 expression in gastric cancer.
25394359	Abstract	Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a small 21-amino acid peptide that is known to exert diverse biological effects on a wide variety of tissues and cell types through its own receptors. The ET-1-ETRA axis is frequently dysfunctional in numerous types of carcinomas, and contributes to the promotion of cell growth and migration. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play a critical role in carcinogenesis through mRNA degradation or the translational inhibition of cancer-associated protein-coding genes. However, the role of ET-1 and the relationship between ET-1 and miRNAs in gastric cancer remain unknown. Results of the analysis of the database of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that ET-1 is significantly overexpressed in gastric cancer cells when compared with its expression in adjacent normal cells. Exogenous ET-1 significantly enhanced gastric cancer cell proliferation, implying that ET-1 plays an oncogenic role in gastric cancer carcinogenesis. Using a luciferase reporter assay we showed that 18 miRNA candidates had a significant silencing effect on ET-1 expression by up to 20% in HEK293T cells. Among them, 5 miRNAs (miR-1, miR-101, miR-125A, miR-144 and let-7c) were shown to be involved in ET-1 silencing through post-transcriptional modulation in gastric cancer. Our data also revealed that DNA hypermethylation contributes to the silenced miR-1 expression in gastric cancer cells. The ectopic expression of miR-1 significantly inhibited AGS cell proliferation by suppressing ET-1 expression. Overall, our study revealed that ET-1 overexpression may be due to DNA hypermethylation resulting in the silencing of miR-1 expression in gastric cancer cells. In addition, we identified several miRNAs as potential modulators for ET-1 in gastric cancer, which may be used as targets for gastric cancer therapy.

25395097	Title	Overexpression of activated leukocute cell adhesion molecule in gastric cancer is associated with advanced stages and poor prognosis and miR-9 deregulation.
25395097	Abstract	Activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM) has been identified as a novel potential molecular marker of human tumors. The present study aimed to assess ALCAM as a prognostic marker for gastric cancer (GC), and to explore the mRNA deregulation underlying the abnormal expression of ALCAM. The mRNA and protein expression of ALCAM in GC and adjacent non‑tumor tissues from 66 patients with GC were analyzed. The association between miR‑9 and ALCAM mRNA expression was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Serum soluble ALCAM (sALCAM) was analyzed by ELISA in 72 patients with GC, 82 patients with gastric precancerous lesions and 73 controls. ALCAM and sALCAM levels were associated with certain clinicopathological variables, including overall survival. Compared with the non‑tumor tissues, the expression of ALCAM mRNA in the GC tissues was significantly upregulated (P=0.013). The expression of miR‑9 was reduced and inversely correlated with ALCAM mRNA levels in GC tissues and cell lines. The ALCAM mRNA level was reduced following ectopic overexpression of miR‑9 in SGC‑7901 human gastric cancer cells. The rates of membranous and cytoplasmic expression of ALCAM in GC tissues were 59.1 and 48.48%, respectively, and the serum sALCAM levels were significantly elevated in patients with GC. Elevated ALCAM mRNA, membranous ALCAM expression in GC tissues and high sALCAM levels are associated with advanced tumor stage, lymphatic invasion and shorter overall survival duration. The results of the current study indicated that membranous ALCAM expression and high serum sALCAM levels are independent prognostic markers of poor survival for patients with GC, and that the overexpression of ALCAM may be due to the downregulation of miR‑9.

25400827	Title	MiR-19a promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition through PI3K/AKT pathway in gastric cancer.
25400827	Abstract	It has been reported that miR-19a was up-regulated in gastric cancer (GC), playing an oncogenic role. However, the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Therefore, in our present study, we investigated the role of miR-19a in gastric tissues as well as 2 GC cell lines. In vivo in clinical tissue level, we have detected basal expression level of miR-19a using real-time reversal transcriptional PCR (RT-PCR); in addition, the relevance between expression of miR-19a and clinic-pathological information was also analyzed. In vitro in cell line level, miR-19a was ectopically expressed using over expression and knock-down strategy. It was found that the overexpression of miR-19a was significantly associated with metastasis of GC and inferior overall prognosis on clinical tissue level; that promotes the proliferation, migration and invasion; and that overexpression of miR-19a can promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition through activating PI3K/AKT pathway. Blocking the PI3K/AKT pathway could cancel the effect of miR-19a. All together, our results suggest that miR-19a could be used as a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of GC.

25407491	Title	miR-103/107 modulates multidrug resistance in human gastric carcinoma by downregulating Cav-1.
25407491	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-protein-coding small RNAs with the capacity to regulate fundamental biological processes essential for cancer initiation and progression. In the present study, we analyzed miRNA expression levels between multidrug-resistant gastric carcinoma cell line SGC7901/ADR and its parent cell line SGC7901 using a miRNA microarray. MiR-103/107 was downregulated compared with parental SGC7901 cells. Overexpression of miR-103/107 sensitized SGC7901/ADR cells to doxorubicin (DOX), as demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo drug sensitivity assay. We further confirmed that miR-103/107 inhibited P-gp function in gastric cancer SGC7901/ADR cells. Finally, we verified that caveolin-1 (Cav-1), a critical component of lipid rafts, was a target of miR-103/107.

25411357	Title	Epigenetic modulation and repression of miR-200b by cancer-associated fibroblasts contribute to cancer invasion and peritoneal dissemination in gastric cancer.
25411357	Abstract	Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) have recently been linked to the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer. In addition, the microRNA (miR)-200 family plays a central role in the regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition process during cancer metastasis, and aberrant DNA methylation is one of the key mechanisms underlying regulation of the miR-200 family. In this study, we clarified whether epigenetic changes of miR-200b by CAFs stimulate cancer invasion and peritoneal dissemination in gastric cancer. We evaluated the relationship between miR-200b and CAFs using a coculture model. In addition, we established a peritoneal metastasis mouse model and investigated the expression and methylation status of miR-200b. We also investigated the expression and methylation status of miR-200b and CAFs expression in primary gastric cancer samples. CAFs (CAF-37 and CAF-50) contributed to epigenetic changes of miR-200b, reduced miR-200b expression and promoted tumor invasion and migration in NUGC3 and OCUM-2M cells in coculture. In the model mice, epigenetic changes of miR-200b were observed in the inoculated high-frequency peritoneal dissemination cells. In the 173 gastric cancer samples, the low miR-200b expression group demonstrated a significantly poorer prognosis compared with the high miR-200b expression group and was associated with peritoneal metastasis. In addition, downregulation of miR-200b in cancer cells was significantly correlated with alpha-smooth muscle actin expression. Our data provide evidence that CAFs reduce miR-200b expression and promote tumor invasion through epigenetic changes of miR-200b in gastric cancer. Thus, CAFs might be a therapeutic target for inhibition of gastric cancer.

25412959	Title	miR-194 targets RBX1 gene to modulate proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells.
25412959	Abstract	RING box protein1 (RBX1), an essential component of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases, plays an important role in gastric cancer. In the study, miR-194 and RBX1 expression was evaluated in 76 pairs of gastric tumor and non-tumor tissue samples by qRT-PCR, and clinicopathological characteristics were analyzed. CCK8, transwell assay, wound healing assay, and flow cytometry assay were performed to evaluate the effect of miR-194 on gastric cancer (GC) cellular proliferation, invasion, migration, apoptosis, and cell cycle, respectively. Luciferase reporter assays and Western blotting were used to evaluate whether RBX1 is a direct target of miR-194. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were used to evaluate the correlation between miR-194 or RBX1 expression and patient survival. Then, we found that miR-194 was significantly downregulated and RBX1 upregulated in GC tissues; both of which showed significant association with tumor size, location, invasion, and tumor node metastasis. Cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were significantly restricted with miR-194 overexpression. miR-194 downregulated RBX1 protein expression, and luciferase assays showed that binding sites in the RBX1 3'UTR were required for miR-194-mediated repression of RBX1, indicating that RBX1 was a direct target of miR-194. Transfection of RBX1 without the 3'UTR restored the miR-194-inhibiting migration function. miR-194 overexpression or RBX1 lowexpression was associated with prolonged survival of GC patients. In conclusion, upregulation of miR-194 can inhibit proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells, possibly by targeting RBX1. Aberrant expression of miR-194 and RBX1 is correlated to GC patient survival time.

25428377	Title	MicroRNA-29s could target AKT2 to inhibit gastric cancer cells invasion ability.
25428377	Abstract	AKT2 is a crucial mediator in the tumorigenesis and thought to be an ideal target for the treatment of malignancies. Increasing evidence has also shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) could regulate or be regulated by mRNAs and they also might serve as therapeutic agencies or targets. MiR-29s (miR-29a, miR-29b and miR-29c) had been approved that they decreased in gastric cancers (GC) by targeting CCND2, MMP2 and p42.3. However, whether miR-29s would target AKT2 have not been investigated in GC. Here, we explored the relationship between miR-29s and AKT2 and found that in GC cell lines (HGC-27 and MGC-803) and GC clinical samples the decreased levels of miR-29s accompanied by increased AKT2 expression. Introduction of miR-29s into GC cells resulted in decreased AKT2 expression and decreased the ability of cancer cells invasion, so did the siRNA-AKT2. Our studies revealed that miR-29s expression is downregulated in GC and they could repress the AKT2 expression and the inactivation of AKT and GSK3beta leading to inhibit the GC cells invasion. Taken together, our findings suggested that AKT2 may be one of the targets of miR29s in gastric cancer. By increasing the expression of miR-29s or decreasing AKT2 expression may be promising in combating with GC.

25428912	Title	Reduced miR-126 expression facilitates angiogenesis of gastric cancer through its regulation on VEGF-A.
25428912	Abstract	miR-126 is an endothelial-specific microRNA essential for governing vascular integrity and angiogenesis. Its role in tumor angiogenesis of gastric cancer (GC) is unclear. This study aimed at determining the role of miR-126 in GC angiogenesis. Down-regulation of miR-126 was found to inversely correlate with an increased microvessel density (MVD) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) expression in gastric cancer tissues. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-126 directly targeted the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of VEGF-A mRNA. In addition, the restoration of miR-126 expression by lentivirus-miR-126 (Lenti-miR-126) transfection obviously reduced the expression of VEGF-A and the activition of its downstream genes, Akt, mTOR and Erk1/2 in gastric cancer cell lines SGC-7901, MKN-28 and MKN-45. In contrast, the down-regulation of miR-126 expression by lentivirus-anti-miR-126 (Lenti-anti-miR-126) transfection obviously up-regulated the expression of VEGF-A and its downstream signaling pathways. In vivo xenograft mice model experiments clarified the down-regulation of VEGF-A and MVD as well as inhibition of tumor growth by up-regulation of miR-126. Overall, the results from our study suggested that miR-126 could suppress tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis of GC through VEGF-A signaling, and it is a novel potential therapeutic target for GC.

25429829	Title	MicroRNA-204-5p inhibits gastric cancer cell proliferation by downregulating USP47 and RAB22A.
25429829	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a type of small noncoding RNAs that are strongly implicated in carcinogenesis. However, the potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic roles of the majority of miRNAs in the pathological processes of tumorigenesis remain largely unknown. Our and others' data revealed that miR-204-5p was significantly downregulated in gastrointestinal tumor tissues compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues. The downregulation of miR-204-5p was confirmed in our gastric cancer (GC) cohort, and we showed that ectopic expression of miR-204-5p inhibited, whereas silencing miR-204-5p expression promoted GC cell proliferation in vitro. Subsequent mechanistic investigations identified that USP47 and RAB22A are direct functional targets of miR-204-5p in GC. Silencing the expression of USP47 and RAB22A using siRNA phenocopied the proliferation-inhibiting function of miR-204-5p in GC cells. Our results uncovered that miR-204-5p acts as a tumor suppressor in GC through inhibiting USP47 and RAB22A.

25432696	Title	MicroRNA-542-3p suppresses cell growth of gastric cancer cells via targeting oncogene astrocyte-elevated gene-1.
25432696	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested to play critical roles in tumorigenesis as well as in the development of therapies for the treatment of cancers. However, the tumor-associated miRNAs in gastric cancers remain poorly understood. Here, we report on miR-542-3p in gastric cancers, which has been widely studied in other cancers as a tumor suppressor. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that miR-542-3p was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues (p < 0.0001) and cell lines (p < 0.001). Overexpression of miR-542-3p significantly inhibited cell growth of gastric cancer cells both in vitro (p < 0.01) and in vivo (p < 0.01). Notably, overexpression of miR-542-3p apparently reduced the protein expression of astrocyte-elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) (p < 0.01). The dual-luciferase reporter assay validated that miR-542-3p directly bound the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of AEG-1, which could be abolished by mutation of the predicted miR-542-3p binding site. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-542-3p markedly inhibited the activation of oncogenic signaling pathways including the Akt, Beta-catenin and nuclear factor-KappaB pathways. Additionally, overexpression of AEG-1 without the 3'-UTR partially reversed the cell growth arrest induced by miR-542-3p overexpression in gastric cancer cells (p < 0.05). Taken together, these data suggest that miR-542-3p might function as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, potentially by targeting the oncogene AEG-1, implying a potential role for miR-542-3p in the development of therapeutic methods for gastric cancer.

25433493	Title	The role of microRNA-133b and its target gene FSCN1 in gastric cancer.
25433493	Abstract	BackgroundIncreasing evidences have documented that microRNAs (miRNAs) act as oncogenes or tumor suppressors in gastric cancer (GC). In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression of miR-133b in a large number of GC samples and elucidate its role in GC carcinogenesis and the detailed mechanism.MethodsWe used Taqman probe stem-loop real-time PCR to accurately measure the levels of miR-133b in 100 pairs of gastric cancer tissues and the adjacent non-neoplastic tissues. miR-133b mimics were overexpressed in GC cell lines, miR-133b inhibitors were also introduced in GES cells to investigate its role on regulating cell proliferation, cell migration and cell invasion. The target of miR-133b was identified by luciferase reporter assay and western blot. Fascin actin-bundling protein 1 (FSCN1) siRNA was used to achieve the knockdown of FSCN1 in GC cells and to investigate its role on modulating GC cell proliferation and invasion.ResultsmiR-133b was significantly down-regulated in GC cell lines and in GC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Moreover, lower-level of miR-133b was also associated with venous invasion and a more aggressive tumor phenotype. Re-introduction of miR-133b in GC cells can inhibit cell proliferation, cell migration and invasion. In contrary, knockdown of miR-133b in GES cells can promote cell proliferation and invasion. Further investigation indicated that miR-133b targeted FSCN1 in GC cells and knockdown of FSCN1 can also inhibit GC cell growth and invasion.ConclusionOur findings demonstrated that miR-133b was significantly down-regulated in GC tissues and exerted its tumor suppressor role in GC cells. The investigation of the detailed mechanism showed that miR-133b directly targeted FSCN1 which functioned as an oncogenic gene in GC cells. These results suggested that miR-133b can be developed as a new diagnostic marker or therapeutic target for GC.

25448600	Title	MiR-199a-3p promotes gastric cancer progression by targeting ZHX1.
25448600	Abstract	Accumulating evidence has indicated that microRNAs (miRNAs) act as critical epigenetic regulators in tumor carcinogenesis. Here, we report that miR-199a-3p was significantly upregulated in gastric cancer (GC) cell lines and tissues. Functional studies demonstrated that miR-199a-3p dramatically increased cell proliferation and suppressed cell apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the transcriptional regulator zinc fingers and homeoboxes 1 (ZHX1) was identified as one of the direct downstream targets of miR-199a-3p, miR-199a-3p bound to the ZHX1 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) to regulate ZHX1 protein expression. In addition, the expression of miR-199a-3p was inversely associated with that of ZHX1 in GC cell lines. Overexpression of miR-199a-3p in SGC-7901 cells inhibited ZHX1 expression, while reduction in miR-199a-3p by inhibitors in NCI-N87 cells enhanced ZHX1 expression. Moreover, restoring ZHX1 expression in SGC-7901/miR-199a-3p cells inhibited the cell proliferation induced by miR-199a-3p. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-199a-3p may function as a novel tumor promoter in GC and its oncogenic activity may involve the direct targeting and inhibition of ZHX1.

25449437	Title	Epstein-Barr virus miR-BART20-5p regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis by targeting BAD.
25449437	Abstract	Although Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) BamHI A rightward transcript (BART) microRNAs (miRNAs) are ubiquitously expressed in EBV-associated tumors, the role of most BART miRNAs is unclear. In this study, we showed that Bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD) expression was significantly lower in EBV-infected AGS-EBV cells than in EBV-negative AGS cells and investigated whether BART miRNAs target BAD. Using bioinformatics analysis, five BART miRNAs showing seed match with the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of BAD were selected. Of these, only miR-BART20-5p reduced BAD expression when individually transfected into AGS cells. A luciferase assay revealed that miR-BART20-5p directly targets BAD. The expression of BAD mRNA and protein was decreased by miR-BART20-5p and increased by an inhibitor of miR-BART20-5p. PE-Annexin V staining and cell proliferation assays showed that miR-BART20-5p reduced apoptosis and enhanced cell growth. Furthermore, miR-BART20-5p increased chemoresistance to 5-fluorouracil and docetaxel. Our data suggest that miR-BART20-5p contributes to tumorigenesis of EBV-associated gastric carcinoma by directly targeting the 3'-UTR of BAD.

25470111	Title	Catenin-Delta1, negatively regulated by miR-145, promotes tumour aggressiveness in gastric cancer.
25470111	Abstract	Increasing evidence supports the association of catenin-Delta1 (CTNND1, p120ctn) with tumour development and progression. However, the mechanism and clinical significance of CTNND1 deregulation in gastric cancer remain unknown. The expression level and cellular localization of CTNND1 were determined by immunohistochemistry in 126 human gastric cancer and 50 non-tumourous tissues. The cellular localization of CTNND1 and epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) were detected by immunofluorescence. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion assays were performed to assess the effect of CTNND1 cDNA or CTNND1 siRNA transfection on gastric cancer cells. Luciferase assay, western blot analysis and in vivo assays were used to determine whether CTNND1 could be regulated by miR-145. The results demonstrate that the cytoplasmic localization of CTNND1 protein, rather than expression level, was indicative of higher clinical stage, positive lymph node metastasis and poorer prognosis in gastric cancers. CTNND1 could promote gastric cancer cell migration and invasion with little effect on cellular proliferation and apoptosis. CTNND1 was proved to be a direct target gene for miR-145. Besides suppressing cytoplasmic CTNND1 expression, miR-145 could recover the membranous localization of CTNND1 and E-cadherin. We conclude that cytoplasmic CTNND1 can serve as an independent prognostic factor for patients with gastric cancers. MiR-145 inhibits invasion of gastric cancer cells not only by down-regulating cytoplasmic CTNND1 expression but also by inducing the translocation of CTNND1 and E-cadherin from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane through down-regulating N-cadherin.

25475733	Title	Methylation-associated silencing of miR-495 inhibit the migration and invasion of human gastric cancer cells by directly targeting PRL-3.
25475733	Abstract	Phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3) is believed to be associated with cell motility, invasion, and metastasis. Our previous work found that PRL-3 is highly overexpressed in gastric cancer (GC) tissue with peritoneal metastasis and directly involved in the pathogenesis of GC peritoneal metastasis. Moreover, we further found that the down-regulation of endogenous miR-495 expression plays a causative role in over expression of PRL-3 in GC peritoneal metastasis. However, the molecular regulation mechanisms by which endogenous miR-495 expression is down-regulated and PRL-3 promotes GC peritoneal metastasis remain to be clearly elucidated. Some studies have shown that the promoter methylation is closely related to the miRNA gene expression. Therefore, in present study, based on our previous findings, we will analysis whether DNA methylation is a major cause of the down-expression of endogenous miR-495, which results in PRL-3 overexpression in GC peritoneal metastasis. Methylation specific PCR (MSP) and sodium bisulfite sequencing method (BSP) detected miR-495 gene promoter methylation status. We treated GC cell lines with 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) to make the gene promoter methylation inactivation. By treating with 5-Aza-dC the migration and invasion of GC cells were significantly inhibited. And the miR-495 was overexpressing, corresponds to the mRNA and protein levels of PRL-3 were reduced, the ability of invasion and metastasis was inhibited. This study suggest that miR-495 have tumor suppressor properties and are partially silenced by DNA hypermethylation in GC, will provide new strategies for prevention and treatment of GC peritoneal metastasis.

25479940	Title	Chronic inflammation with Helicobacter pylori infection is implicated in CD44 overexpression through miR-328 suppression in the gastric mucosa.
25479940	Abstract	Infection with Helicobacter pylori is the main risk factor for development of gastric cancer. CD44 overexpression, especially that of variant 9 (CD44v9), has also been implicated in the local inflammatory response and metaplasia-carcinoma sequence in human stomach. We recently identified miR-328 as one of the microRNAs targeting CD44 in gastric cancer. The aim of the current study was to determine the relationship between miR-328 and CD44v9 expression in H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa during the development of preneoplastic lesions. Immunohistochemical staining of myeloperoxidase and CD44v9 was performed using paraffin-embedded tissue sections obtained from 54 patients who underwent gastric resection without preoperative treatment. The levels of miR-328 expression in the gastric mucosa were measured in the same patients using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Both infiltration of myeloperoxidase-positive inflammatory cells and expression of proinflammatory cytokines closely correlated with H. pylori infection in the cancer-afflicted gastric mucosa. High CD44v9 expression levels, identified in the gastric mucosa in 61 % of samples (33/54), correlated significantly with H. pylori infection in the gastric mucosa. Notably, high CD44v9 expression was significantly associated with low miR-328 expression, whereas low CD44v9 expression was significantly associated with high miR-328 expression. We showed that miR-328 downregulation and de novo expression of CD44v9 occurred in H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa adjacent to gastric cancer compared with gastric mucosa not infected with H. pylori adjacent to gastric cancer. CD44v9-overexpressing cells are known to acquire reactive oxygen species resistance; thus, these cells may avoid cell death caused by various stress inducers, which may be linked to the origin of gastric cancer development.

25489984	Title	The microRNA-367 inhibits the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer by directly repressing Rab23.
25489984	Abstract	Dysregulated expression of microRNAs is often found in gastric cancer, and it contributes to the pathogenesis of gastric cancer via regulation of the cell cycle, proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of miR-367 in the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer. The correlation between the expression level of miR-367 and the clinicopathologic features of 37 patients with gastric cancer was analyzed by using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In addition, we investigated the effect of miR-367 on the invasion and migration of the gastric cancer cell lines HS746T and SGC-7901 using transwell and scratch-wound assays, and the target gene of miR-367 was predicated and demonstrated by the bioinformatics method and luciferase reporter system, respectively. The results showed that the expression of miR-367 was significantly reduced in the gastric cancer tissues compared with the paraneoplastic tissues, and significantly correlated with the differentiation level, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, and metastasis of gastric cancer. Notably, the overexpression of miR-367 in gastric cancer cells inhibited the cellular migration and invasion. Furthermore, the luciferase reporter system demonstrated that Rab23 was a target gene of miR-367, and ectopic expression of Rab23 could reverse the invasion and migration inhibitory activity of miR-367. Our study shows that miR-367 is a key negative regulator of the invasion and metastasis of gastric cancer and establishes a strong rationale for developing miR-367 as a novel therapeutic agent against gastric cancer.

25492481	Title	Involvement of miR-143 in cisplatin resistance of gastric cancer cells via targeting IGF1R and BCL2.
25492481	Abstract	We investigated the possible role of miR-143 in the development of cisplatin resistance in human gastric cancer cell line. miR-143 was detected by quantitative real-time PCR. Cisplatin resistance changes of cells was tested via MTT assay. Target genes of miR-143 were verified by dual-luciferase activity assay. Immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence staining, Western blot, cell proliferation, and clonogenic and apoptosis assay were used to elucidate the mechanism of miR-143 in cisplatin resistance formation. miR-143 was downregulated in gastric cancer tissues and cell lines. It was also downregulated in cisplatin-resistant gastric cancer cell line SGC7901/cisplatin (DDP), which was concurrent with the upregulation of IGF1R and BCL2, compared with the parental SGC7901 cell line, respectively. Overexpressed miR-143 sensitized SGC7901/DDP cells to cisplatin. The luciferase activity suggested that IGF1R and BCL2 were both target genes of miR-143. Enforced miR-143 reduced its target proteins, inhibited SGC7901/DDP cells proliferation, and sensitized SGC7901/DDP cells to DDP-induced apoptosis. Our findings suggested that hsa-miR-143 could modulate cisplatin resistance of human gastric cancer cell line at least in part by targeting IGF1R and BCL2.

25499265	Title	Involvement of aberrant miR-139/Jun feedback loop in human gastric cancer.
25499265	Abstract	Accumulating evidence indicates that some miRNAs could form feedback loops with their targets to fine-tune tissue homeostasis, while disruption of these loops constitutes an essential step towards human tumorigenesis. In this study, we report the identification of a novel negative feedback loop formed between miR-139 and its oncogenic target Jun. In this loop, miR-139 could inhibit Jun expression by targeting a conserved site on its 3'-UTR, whereas Jun could induce miR-139 expression in a dose dependent manner through a distant upstream regulatory element. Interestingly, aberration in this loop was found in human gastric cancer, where miR-139 was down-regulated and inversely correlated with Jun expression. Further functional analysis showed that restored expression of miR-139 in gastric cancer cells significantly induces apoptosis, and inhibits cell migration and proliferation as well as tumour growth through targeting Jun. Thus, our data strongly suggests a role of aberrant miR-139/Jun negative feedback loop in the development of human gastric cancer and miR-139 as a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer. Given that miR-139 and Jun are deregulated in many cancers, our findings here might have broader implication in other types of human cancers.

25502084	Title	The downregulation of miR-200c/141 promotes ZEB1/2 expression and gastric cancer progression.
25502084	Abstract	Gastric cancer is the fourth most common malignancy in the world. Although microRNA-200 (miR-200) family members are thought to play roles in tumorigenesis, their functions in carcinogenesis are tumor specific, and the underlying mechanism of action still remains elusive. Few studies to date have addressed the dysregulation and function of miR-200 family members in gastric cancer progression. Here, we report that the miR-200 family members, miR-200c and miR-141, were significantly downregulated in gastric cancer specimens and gastric cancer cell lines. Importantly, on clinical samples, the expression of miR-200c and miR-141 was inversely correlated with TNM stage, tumor invasion depth (T), tumor embolus and disease-free survival. Wound-healing assay results showed that co-transfected miR-200c/141 could inhibit the migration and invasion capability of the gastric cell line SGC-7901. We also found that miR-200c and miR-141 directly targeted zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1/2 (ZEB1/2) and upregulated E-cadherin expression. In specimens from gastric cancer patients, reduced expression of miR-200c/141 was associated with increased expression of ZEB1 and/or ZEB2. In addition, the downregulation of miR-200c and miR-141 was found to be due to a highly methylated CpG island located upstream of their genomic sequence and/or upregulated TGF-Beta signaling. Treatment with the chemotherapeutic agent decitabine, a known DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, increased miR-200c/141 expression and ameliorated decreased expression of miR-200c/141 induced by TGF-Beta in SGC-7901 cells. Our study revealed that miR-200c/141 was downregulated by CpG island methylation and TGF-Beta signaling, which decreased ZEB1/2 expression and increased E-cadherin expression to inhibit migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells and provides powerful evidence for the application of decitabine in gastric cancer treatment.

25503559	Title	Epigenetic silencing of miR-490-3p reactivates the chromatin remodeler SMARCD1 to promote Helicobacter pylori-induced gastric carcinogenesis.
25503559	Abstract	Chromatin remodeling has emerged as a hallmark of gastric cancer, but the regulation of chromatin regulators other than genetic change is unknown. Helicobacter pylori causes epigenetic dysregulation to promote gastric carcinogenesis, but the roles and functions of microRNAs (miRNA) in this multistage cascade are not fully explored. In this study, miRNA expression in preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions in murine stomachs induced by H. pylori and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU) was profiled by miRNA expression array. miR-490-3p exhibited progressive downregulation in gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, and adenocarcinoma during H. pylori and MNU-induced gastric carcinogenesis. Significant downregulation of miR-490-3p was confirmed in human gastric cancer tissues in which its regulatory region was found to be hypermethylated. miR-490-3p exerted growth- and metastasis-suppressive effects on gastric cancer cells through directly targeting SMARCD1, a SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeling complex subunit. Knockdown of SMARCD1 significantly attenuated the protumorigenic effects of miR-490-3p inhibitor, whereas enforced expression of SMARCD1 promoted in vitro and in vivo oncogenic phenotypes of gastric cancer cells. SMARCD1 was markedly upregulated in gastric cancer in which its high expression was associated with shortened patients' survival independent of TNM staging. In conclusion, hypermethylation-mediated silencing of miR-490-3p reactivates SMARCD1 to confer malignant phenotypes, mechanistically linking H. pylori, chromatin remodeling, and gastric carcinogenesis.

25516656	Title	MiR-374b-5p suppresses RECK expression and promotes gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis.
25516656	Abstract	To profile expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in gastric cancer cells and investigate the effect of miR-374b-5p on gastric cancer cell invasion and metastasis. An miRNA microarray assay was performed to identify miRNAs differentially expressed in gastric cancer cell lines (MGC-803 and SGC-7901) compared with a normal gastric epithelial cell line. Upregulation of miR-374b-5p was newly identified and confirmed via quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). MGC-803 cells were transfected with a synthesized anti-miR-374b-5p sequence or a control vector using Lipofectamine reagent, or treated with transfection reagent alone or phosphate-buffered saline as controls. Rate of transfection was verified after 48 h by qRT-PCR. Cells were then subjected to transwell migration, wound scratch and cell counting kit-8 assays. A bioinformatic analysis to identify miR-374b-5p target genes was performed using miRanda, PicTar and TargetScan software. A dual luciferase reporter assay was performed to evaluate the influence of miR-374b-5p on target gene activation, and qRT-PCR and Western blot were used to evaluate the levels of target mRNA and protein following transfection with miR-374b-5p antisense oligonucleotides. The microarray profiling revealed downregulation of 14 (fold change < 0.667; P < 0.05) and upregulation of 12 (fold change > 1.50; P < 0.05) miRNAs in MGC-803 and SGC-7901 cells compared with GES-1 controls. The upregulation of miR-374b-5p (fold change = 1.75 and 1.64 in MGC-803 and SGC-7901, respectively; P < 0.05) was confirmed by qRT-PCR. Compared with the control groups, the restoration of miR-374b-5p expression with anti-miR-374b-5p significantly suppressed the metastasis, invasion and proliferation of MGC-803 cells. The bioinformatic analysis predicted that the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with Kazal motif (RECK) contains three miR-374b-5p target sequences. RECK was verified as a target gene in a dual luciferase reporter assay showing that activation of RECK 3'UTR-pmirGLO was increased by co-transfection with miR-374b-5p. Finally, transfection of miR-374b-5p antisense oligonucleotides increased mRNA and protein levels of RECK in MGC-803 cells (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that upregulation of miR-374b-5p contributes to gastric cancer cell metastasis and invasion through inhibition of RECK expression.

25520857	Title	Methylation-associated silencing of MicroRNA-335 contributes tumor cell invasion and migration by interacting with RASA1 in gastric cancer.
25520857	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that function as endogenous silencers of target genes, previous studies have shown that miR-335 play an important role in suppressing metastasis and migration in human cancer including gastric cancer (GC). However, the mechanisms which result in aberrant expression of miR-335 in GC are still unknown. Recent studies have shown that the silencing of some miRNAs is associated with DNA hypermethylation. In this study, we find the promoter of miR-335 we embedded in CpG island by accessing to bioinformatics data and the low expression of miR-335 in 5 gastric cell lines can be restored by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) treatment. So we postulated that the miR-335 genes undergo epigenetic inactivation in GC. Subsequently, in GC cells and tissues, we performed quantitative real-time PCR (RTQ-PCR) to assess the expression of miR-335, and methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and bisulfite sequence-PCR (BSP) to evaluate the DNA methylation status in the CpG islands upstream of MiR-335. The result showed that the expression of miR-335 was significantly reduce in gastric cancer cell lines and tumor tissues compared to matched normal gastric tissues, and cell lines, and which is inverse correlation with DNA hypermethylation of miR-335 both in GC cells lines and tissues, but not in normal tissues. In addition, we found that the lower miR-335 expression induced by abnormal methylation may be mainly involved in gastric cell invasion and metastasis in GC tissues. No statistical significance was found about miR-335 expression and methylation level between healthy individuals with and without H. pylori (HP) infection. Finally, we carry out miRNA transfection, RTQ-PCR and western blot assay to find the RAS p21 protein activator (GTPase activating protein) 1 (RASA1) may be the possible target genes which lead to the gastric cell invasion and metastasis, furthermore, the re-expression of endogenous miR-335 by 5-Aza-dC treatment can exert effects similar to exogenous miRNAs transfection. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-335 may be silenced by promoter hypermethylation and play important roles in gastric cell invasion and metastasis through its target genes, such as RASA1. Its methylation level might be a predictive epigenetic marker of GC and remodeling on the expression by demethylation can provided a potential therapeutic strategy.

25530421	Title	MicroRNA-103a inhibits gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting c-Myb.
25530421	Abstract	There have been no previous reports concerning functions of miR-103a in gastric cancer (GC) cells. Thus the aim of the study was to investigate its expression and role in development of this tumour. Real-time RT-PCR was performed to detect expression of miR-103a in GC cell lines and clinical cancer specimens. To further understand its role, we restored expression of miR-103a in MGC-803 cell line by transfection with miR-103a mimics or inhibitors. Effects of miR-103a on cell proliferation, migration and invasion on targets were also determined. miR-103a was down-regulated in both GC cell lines and clinical cancer specimens. Meanwhile, its level was closely associated with pM or pTNM stage of GC. Overexpression of miR-103a markedly suppressed proliferation, migration, and invasion of GC cells, while its inhibition significantly accelerated cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Moreover, c-Myb was identified to be a functional downstream target of miR-103a, ectopic expression of which partially reversed suppression of cell proliferation and invasion. Thus our observations suggest that miR-103a functioned as a tumour suppressor by targeting c-Myb. These findings indicate that miR-103a might play a significant role in pathogenesis of GC.

25538559	Title	Rapid regulation of microRNA following induction of long-term potentiation in vivo.
25538559	Abstract	Coordinated regulation of gene expression is essential for consolidation of the memory mechanism, long-term potentiation (LTP). Triggering of LTP by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation rapidly activates constitutive and inducible transcription factors, which promote expression of genes responsible for LTP maintenance. As microRNA (miRNA) coordinate expression of genes related through seed sites, we hypothesize that miRNA contribute to the regulation of the LTP-induced gene response. MiRNA function primarily as negative regulators of gene expression. As LTP induction promotes a generalized rapid up-regulation of gene expression, we predicted a complementary rapid down-regulation of miRNA levels. Accordingly, we carried out global miRNA expression profiling in the rat dentate gyrus 20 min post-LTP induction in vivo. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found a large number of differentially expressed miRNA, the majority down-regulated. Detailed analysis of miR-34a-5p and miR-132-3p revealed this down-regulation was transient and NMDAR-dependent, whereby block of NMDARs released an activity-associated inhibitory mechanism. Furthermore, down-regulation of mature miR-34a-5p and miR-132-3p occurred solely by post-transcriptional mechanisms, occurring despite an associated up-regulation of the pri-miR-132 transcript. To understand how down-regulation of miR-34a-5p and miR-132-3p intersects with the molecular events occurring following LTP, we used bioinformatics to identify potential targets. Previously validated targets included the key LTP-regulated genes Arc and glutamate receptor subunits. Predicted targets included the LTP-linked kinase, Mapk1, and neuropil-associated transcripts Hn1 and Klhl11, which were validated using luciferase reporter assays. Furthermore, we found that the level of p42-Mapk1, the protein encoded by the Mapk1 transcript, was up-regulated following LTP. Together, these data support the interpretation that miRNA, in particular miR-34a-5p and miR-132-3p, make a surprisingly rapid contribution to synaptic plasticity via dis-inhibition of translation of key plasticity-related molecules.

25554419	Title	miR-374a promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion by targeting SRCIN1 in gastric cancer.
25554419	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a prominent role in gastric cancer (GC) initiation and progression. In this study, we found that miR-374a expression was up-regulated in human GC cell lines and tissues. Inhibition of miR-374a suppressed GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and slowed tumor growth in vivo. SRC kinase signaling inhibitor 1 (SRCIN1) was identified as a direct target of miR-374a. Silencing of SRCIN1 significantly enhanced cell proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas SRCIN1 reintroduction partially abrogated the oncogenic effects of miR-374a. Taken together, these findings suggest that miR-374a functions as a candidate oncogene in GC by directly targeting SRCIN1. miR-374a may therefore be useful as a promising therapeutic target for malignant GC.

25561270	Title	MiR-101 inhibits cell growth and tumorigenesis of Helicobacter pylori related gastric cancer by repression of SOCS2.
25561270	Abstract	Several microRNAs (miRNA) have been implicated in H. pylori related gastric cancer (GC). However, the molecular mechanism of miRNAs in gastric cancer has not been fully understood. In this study, we reported that miR-101 is significantly down-regulated in H. pylori positive tissues and cells and in tumor tissues with important functional consequences. Ectopic expression of miR-101 dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation by inducing G1-phase cell-cycle arrest. We found that miR-101 strongly reduced the expression of SOCS2 oncogene in GC cells. Similar to the restoring miR-26 expression, SOCS2 down-regulation inhibited cell growth and cell-cycle progression, whereas SOCS2 over-expression rescued the suppressive effect of miR-101. Mechanistic investigations revealed that miR-101 suppressed the expression of c-myc, CDK2, CDK4, CDK6, CCND2, CCND3, and CCNE2, while promoted tumor suppressor p14, p16, p21 and p27 expression. In clinical specimens, SOCS2 was over-expressed in tumors and H. pylori positive tissues and its mRNA levels were inversely correlated with miR-101 expression. Taken together, our results indicated that miR-101 functions as a growth-suppressive miRNA in H. pylori related GC, and that its suppressive effects are mediated mainly by repressing SOCS2 expression.

25595591	Title	DNMT1 and EZH2 mediated methylation silences the microRNA-200b/a/429 gene and promotes tumor progression.
25595591	Abstract	Aberrant expression of the microRNA-200 (miR-200) family has been linked to the occurrence and development of various types of malignant tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colon cancer and breast cancer. However, little is known about the precise mechanism by which miR-200 expression is downregulated. The intricate relationship between DNA methylation and histone modifications has become a subject of increasing interest. The expression of miR-200 family members is modified by similar or complementary epigenetic mechanisms in MGC-803 and BGC-823 gastric cancer cells and U87 MG glioma cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) bound to miR-200b/a/429 promoter regions, indicating an interaction between DNMT1 and the miR-200b/a/429 promoter. Furthermore, Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) detection showed that DNMT1, together with the PcG protein Enhancer of Zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase, contributed to the transcriptional repression of microRNA-200 family members. Knockdown of EZH2 not only impacted H3K27 trimethylation but also reduced DNMT1 presence on the miR-200b/a/429 promoter. EZH2 appeared to be essential for DNMT1 recruitment to the promoter region. Silencing EZH2 and DNMT1 using drugs or RNA interference dramatically reduced the levels of miR-200b/a/429 expression. Collectively, these results indicated that EZH2 and DNMT1-mediated epigenetic silencing contributed to the progression of gastric cancer and glioblastoma, and therefore represents a novel therapeutic target for malignant tumors.

25595906	Title	MicroRNA-500 sustains nuclear factor-KappaB activation and induces gastric cancer cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis.
25595906	Abstract	Ubiquitin deconjugation of key signalling molecules by deubiquitinases (DUBs) such as cylindromatosis (CYLD), A20, and OTU deubiquitinase 7B (OTUD7B) has emerged as an important regulatory mechanism in the downregulation of NF-KappaB signalling and homeostasis. However, how these serial negative regulations are simultaneously disrupted to result in constitutive activation of NF-KappaB signalling in cancers remains puzzling. Here, we report that the miR-500 directly repressed the expression of CYLD, OTUD7B, and the A20 complex component Tax1-binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1), leading to ubiquitin conjugation of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and sustained NF-Ä¸B activation. Furthermore, we found that miR-500 promoted gastric cancer cell proliferation, survival, and tumorigenicity. Importantly, miR-500 was upregulated in gastric cancer and was highly correlated with malignant progression and poor survival. Hence, we report the uncovering of a novel mechanism for constitutive NF-KappaB activation, indicating the potentially pivotal role of miR-500 in the progression of gastric cancer.

25596740	Title	miR-874 functions as a tumor suppressor by inhibiting angiogenesis through STAT3/VEGF-A pathway in gastric cancer.
25596740	Abstract	MicroRNAs are endogenously expressed, small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by targeting mRNAs for translational repression or degradation. Our previous studies indicated that miR-874 played a suppressive role in gastric cancer (GC) development and progression. However, the role of miR-874 in tumor angiogenesis and the mechanisms underlying its function in GC remained to be clarified. Here, gain- and loss-of-function assays demonstrated that miR-874 inhibited the tumor angiogenesis of GC cells in vitro and in vivo. Through reporter gene and western blot assays, STAT3 was shown to be a direct target of miR-874. Overexpression of STAT3 rescued the loss of tumor angiogenesis caused by miR-874. Conversely, the STAT3-shRNA attenuated the increased tumor angiogenesis caused by the miR-874-inhibitor. Furthermore, the levels of miR-874 were inversely correlated with those of STAT3 protein in GC tissues. Taken together, these findings indicate that down-regulation of miR-874 contributes to tumor angiogenesis through STAT3 in GC, highlighting the potential of miR-874 as a target for human GC therapy.

25612651	Title	APRIL induces cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer cells via activation of the NF-KappaB pathway.
25612651	Abstract	A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL) is a tumor-necrosis factor (TNF) family member and is a novel cytokine crucial in sustaining lymphocytic leukemia B cell survival and proliferation. However, its role in gastric cancer (GC) remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the expression pattern and prognostic role of APRIL in GC. Expression of APRIL was assessed by immunohistochemistry and real-time PCR. Prognostic role of APRIL expression was evaluated. We also discovered the effect of APRIL on chemo-resistance in GC cells and the underlying mechanisms. APRIL mRNA levels were significantly increased in GC tissues compared with adjacent tissues and high expression levels of APRIL in tumor cells significantly correlated with poor overall survival in patients receiving cisplatin adjuvant treatment. Overexpression of APRIL in AGS cells significantly attenuated the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, silence of APRIL in SGC7901 cells enhanced cisplatin-induced tumor suppression. Our data further revealed that the canonical NF-KappaB pathway was involved in APRIL-mediated chemo-resistance. In addition, expression of APRIL was regulated by miR-145 in GC cells. APRIL is a novel clinical chemo-resistance biomarker for gastric cancer and might be a promising therapeutic target for GC patients.

25620172	Title	MicroRNA-133a functions as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer.
25620172	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small and highly conserved non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression of target mRNAs through posttranscriptional inhibition involved in the tumorigenesis and progression of multiple malignancies. Although miR-133a has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor in some cancers, the clinical significance and function of miR-133a in gastric cancer remain unclear. Hence, we were focused on the expression and mechanisms of miR-133a in the development of gastric cancer in this study. It was found that the expression of miR-133a was downregulated (P<0.001), while transgelin-2 (TAGLN2) was upregulated (P<0.05) in primary gastric cancer tissues, compared to the adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCT). Furthermore, decreased expression of miR-133a and increased expression of TAGLN2 were both associated with lymph node metastases in patients with gastric cancer (P<0.001; P=0.011). Functional analysis studies revealed that ectopic expression of miR-133a reduced cell proliferation and invasion, and induced cell apoptosis and cycle arrest via suppressing the level of TAGLN2 from transcriptional and translational levels and downregulated the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in gastric cancer cells. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that decreased expression of miR-133a is associated with the lymph node metastases of patients with gastric cancer. Overexpression of miR-133a inhibits cell growth and invasion and induces cell apoptosis and cycle arrest through repressing TAGLN2 gene, suggesting that miR-133a might be used as a biomarker or therapeutic target for the treatment of gastric cancer.

25633292	Title	MicroRNA-141 inhibits tumor growth and metastasis in gastric cancer by directly targeting transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif, TAZ.
25633292	Abstract	Gastric cancer (GC) is a biologically heterogeneous disease accompanying various genetic and epigenetic alterations, and the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease are complex and not completely understood. Increasing evidence shows that abnormal microRNA (miRNA) expression is involved in GC tumorigenesis, but the role of specific miRNAs involved in this disease remains elusive. MiR-141 was previously reported to act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes in diverse cancers. However, their accurate expression, function and mechanism in GC are largely unclear. Here we found that the expression of miR-141 was significantly reduced in GC compared with paired adjacent normal tissues and was significantly correlated with a more aggressive phenotype of GC in patients. Ectopic expression of miR-141 mimics in GC cell lines resulted in reduced proliferation, invasion and migration, and inhibition of miR-141 in GC cell lines promoted cell proliferation, invasion and migration in vitro. We further demonstrated that miR-141 acted as tumor suppressors through targeting transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) in GC. Moreover, the inverse relationship between miR-141 and its target was verified in patients and xenograft mice. Finally, overexpression of miR-141 suppressed tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis in nude mice. Take together, we identified that miR-141 is a potent tumor suppressor in the stomach, and its growth inhibitory effects are, in part, mediated through its downstream target gene, TAZ. These findings implied that miR-141 might be employed as novel prognostic markers and therapeutic targets of GC.

25634213	Title	Chemotherapy-Induced miRNA-29c/Catenin-Delta Signaling Suppresses Metastasis in Gastric Cancer.
25634213	Abstract	Chemotherapy has improved the survival of patients with gastric cancer by unknown mechanisms. In this study, we showed that cisplatin and docetaxel used in gastric cancer treatment increase the expression of miRNA-29 (miR-29) family members and decrease the expression of their oncogenic targets, mediating a significant part of the efficacious benefits of these chemotherapeutic agents. In particular, patients with gastric cancer who experienced recurrences after chemotherapy tended to exhibit low levels of miR-29c expression in their tumors, suggesting that miR-29c activation may contribute to the chemotherapeutic efficacy. Enforced expression of miR-29s in gastric cancer cells inhibited cell invasion in vitro and in vivo by directly targeting catenin-Delta (CTNND1). Drug treatment suppressed gastric cancer cell invasion by restoring miR-29c-mediated suppression of catenin-Delta and RhoA signaling. In parallel, drug treatment also activated several tumor-suppressive miRNAs, thereby decreasing expression of their oncogenic effector targets. Overall, our findings defined a global mechanism for understanding the efficacious effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy in gastric cancer. Cancer Res; 75(7); 1332-44. ©2015 AACR.

25652145	Title	Anti-miR-362-3p Inhibits Migration and Invasion of Human Gastric Cancer Cells by Its Target CD82.
25652145	Abstract	This study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of miR-362-3p on regulation of gastric cancer (GC) cell metastasis potential. We detected miR-362-3p level in GC and adjacent normal tissues and investigated the relationship with clinicopathological factors. Next, we analyzed the level of miR-362-3p expression and CD82 in different differentiated GC cells compared with a normal gastric mucosa cell by RT-PCR and Western blot. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and Western blot confirmed a direct interaction between miR-362-3p and CD82 3'UTR. After miR-362-3p and CD82 were silenced in GC cells, we compared the transfected GC cells migration and invasion capacity by transwell assay. In addition, we detected the effects on cells angiogenesis by tube formation assay. Western blot was used to detect the impact of CD82 and miR-362-3p on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers in treated GC cells. Level of miR-362-3p expression was much higher in GC cells than in normal gastric mucosa cell, and miR-362-3p expression negatively correlated with CD82 mRNA expression in these cell lines. Furthermore, miR-362-3p expression inhibited GC cell metastasis capacity by suppression of CD82 expression. Level of miR-362-3p may mediate E-cadherin, N-cadherin, and vimentin expression in GC cells. This study illuminated that downregulation of miR-362-3p along with the upregulation of CD82 in GC cells resulted in the inhibition of GC migration and invasion. Thus, our results suggested that miR-362-3p or CD82 can be exploited as a new potential target for control of GC in the future.

25653235	Title	Activation of PAX3-MET pathways due to miR-206 loss promotes gastric cancer metastasis.
25653235	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are thought to have an important role in tumor metastasis by regulating diverse cellular pathways. Here, we describe the function and regulation network of miR-206 in gastric cancer (GC) metastasis. MiR-206 expression was downregulated in GC cells especially in high metastatic potential cells and was also significantly decreased in metastatic lesions compared with their corresponding primary tumor samples. Both gain- and loss-of-function studies confirmed that miR-206 significantly suppressed GC cell invasion and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, paired box gene 3 (PAX3) was identified as a functional target of miR-206 in GC cells. MiR-206 inhibited GC metastasis by negatively regulating expression of PAX3. In addition, PAX3 expression was markedly higher in GC tissues than in adjacent non-cancerous tissues. GC patients with positive PAX3 expression had shorter overall survival times. Transwell assays and in vivo metastasis assays demonstrated that overexpression of PAX3 significantly promoted the invasiveness and pulmonary metastasis of GC cells. On the other hand, downregulation of PAX3 markedly reduced cell metastatic potential. Mechanistic investigations indicated that prometastasis function of PAX3 was mediated by upregulating downstream target MET. Moreover, we found that levels of PAX3 and MET were positively correlated in matched human GC specimens, and their coexpression was associated with poor prognoses. In conclusion, our results reveal that miR-206-PAX3-MET signaling is critical to GC metastasis. Targeting the pathway described here may open new therapeutic prospects to restrict the metastatic potential of GC.

25653720	Title	MiR-217 Promotes Tumor Proliferation in Breast Cancer via Targeting DACH1.
25653720	Abstract	The expression of DACH1 was frequently lost in human breast cancer, which significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Herein, we aim to investigate its underlying mechanisms. The expression of miR-217 was detected by Taqman PCR. The mRNA and protein level of DACH1 were investigated by real time PCR and western blot. The dual-luciferase reporter system was used to determine the direct interaction between miR-217 and DACH1. A series of gain&loss of function assays were performed to measure the affects of miR-217 on tumor proliferation and cell cycle distribution. Compared to that in normal breast samples, the expression of miR-217 was significantly upregulated in breast cancer tissues. High level of miR-217 was notably correlated with highly histological grade, the triple negative subtype and advanced tumor stage. Moreover, the expression of miR-217 was negatively correlated with the expression of DACH1. The results of dual-luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that miR-217 directly targets and inhibits the transcriptive activity of DACH1. In vitro, treatment with miR-217 mimics significantly suppressed the proliferation of MCF-7 cells, induced G1 phase arrest and inhibited the expression of cyclin D1; while these effects were significantly reversed by the restoration of DACH1. In MDA-MB-231 cells, treatment with miR-217 inhibitors enhanced the cellular proliferation, promoted cell cycle progression and upregulated the expression of cyclin D1, which were neutralized by the pre-treatment of siRNA-DACH1. In vivo, inhibition of miR-217 significantly suppressed the xenografts growth and downregulated the expression of cyclin D1. We found that miR-217 was commonly overexpressed in breast cancer, which could enhance tumor proliferation via promoting cell cycle progression. Moreover, the DACH1 (the cell fate determination factor) was identified as a novel target of miR-217. Our results proposed inhibiting miR-217 to be a potent therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.

25654811	Title	By downregulating TIAM1 expression, microRNA-329 suppresses gastric cancer invasion and growth.
25654811	Abstract	Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. Emerging evidence has shown that abnormal microRNAs (miRNAs) expression is involved in tumorigenesis. MiR-329 was previously reported to act as a tumor suppressor or oncogene in some types of cancer. However, its function in gastric cancer (GC) is unclear. Here, we found that miR-329 was down-regulated in GC compared with adjacent controls. Enforced expression of miR-329 inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of gastric cancer cells in vitro. We identified T lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (TIAM1) gene as potential target of miR-329. MiR-329 levels inversely correlated with TIAM1 expression in GC. Importantly, TIAM1 rescued the miR-329-mediated inhibition of cell invasion and proliferation. Finally, reintroduction of miR-329 significantly inhibited tumor formation of GC in the xenograft mice. Our findings suggest that miR-329 is a tumor suppressor and potential therapeutic target of GC.

25662441	Title	miR-1182 attenuates gastric cancer proliferation and metastasis by targeting the open reading frame of hTERT.
25662441	Abstract	In humans, telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) determines the activity of telomerase. hTERT is an ideal anticancer target because it is universally expressed in cancer cells and plays a crucial role in carcinogenesis. In this study, we report the miR-1182-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of hTERT. Over-expression of miR-1182 in different gastric cancer cells decreased hTERT protein levels. Bioinformation and dual-luciferase assays revealed that miR-1182 modulated hTERT by binding to its open reading frame (ORF), and this miRNA recognizes elements in the nucleotide region between 2695 and 2719 of hTERT mRNA. Over-expression of hTERT by transfecting pIRES2-hTERT into U2OS cells was abolished by miR-1182, while pIRES2-hTERT-MT, in which miR-1182 target site was synonymously mutated, failed to respond to miR-1182. Further investigation revealed that miR-1182 inhibited gastric cancer proliferation and migration by targeting the ORF1 of hTERT. We also found that miR-1182 could attenuate the proliferative and metastatic potential of SGC-7901 cell in vivo. Moreover, we found a statistically significant inverse correlation between miR-1182 and hTERT protein levels in tissues from 42 gastric cancer patients. These data indicate that miR-1182 suppresses TERT, and thus it could be an effective target for the treatment of gastric cancer.

25678802	Title	MicroRNA-153 acts as a prognostic marker in gastric cancer and its role in cell migration and invasion.
25678802	Abstract	MicroRNA (miRNA)-153 (miR-153) has been considered as a novel tumor-related miRNA and is found to be significantly deregulated in human cancers. In this study, we found that the expression levels of miR-153 were obviously lower in gastric cancer tissues than those in matched adjacent nontumor tissues. Otherwise, miR-153 was expressed at significantly lower levels in aggressive tumor tissues. Clinical association analysis indicated that low expression of miR-153 was prominently correlated with poor prognostic features in gastric cancer. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the low expression of miR-153 was correlated with short 5-year survival of gastric cancer patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that miR-153 was an independent prognostic marker in gastric cancer. Our in vitro studies showed that upregulation of miR-153 reduced cell migration and invasion in MKN-45 cells. Meanwhile, downregulation of miR-153 promoted SGC-7901 cell migration and invasion. An inverse correlation between miR-153 and SNAI1 expression was observed in gastric cancer tissues. In addition, upregulation of miR-153 reduced SNAI1 expression and subsequently suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) with elevated expression of E-cadherin and reduced expression of vimentin in MKN-45 cells. Furthermore, downregulation of miR-153 increased SNAI1 expression and promoted EMT in SGC-7901 cells. In conclusion, miR-153 is an independent prognostic marker for predicting survival of gastric cancer patients and may promote gastric cancer cell migration and invasion, by inhibiting SNAI1-induced EMT.

25682742	Title	MicroRNA-182 inhibits proliferation through targeting oncogenic ANUBL1 in gastric cancer.
25682742	Abstract	MicroRNA-182 (miR-182) is significantly downregulated in human gastric tissue samples. Overexpression of miR-182 suppresses the proliferation and colony formation of gastric cancer cells. However, new aspects of the mechanism are still emerging in gastric cancer. ANUBL1, also known as ZFAND4 (zinc finger, AN1-type domain 4), its roles are scarely reported in cancer. In this study, we not only showed that ANUBL1 as an oncogene was upregulated and could promote proliferation of SGC-7901 cells, but also demonstrated that its over-expression led to a strong decrease of miR-182 expression and expression of ANUBL1 was in turn directly downregulated by miR-182, thereby establishing a negative feedback loop between miR-182 and ANUBL1. The elucidation of the mechanisms of miR-182 targeting ANUBL1 in gastric cancer helps us to further understand the mechanism of gastric cancer initiation and progression.

25694126	Title	Thermo-chemotherapy Induced miR-218 upregulation inhibits the invasion of gastric cancer via targeting Gli2 and E-cadherin.
25694126	Abstract	Thermo-chemotherapy has been proven to reduce the invasion capability of cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this anti-invasion effect is still unclear. In this study, the role of thermo-chemotherapy in the inhibition of tumor invasion was studied. The results demonstrated that expression of miR-218 was downregulated in gastric cancer tissues, which had a positive correlation with tumor invasion and metastasis. In vitro thermo-chemotherapy increased miR-218 expression in SGC7901 cells and inhibited both proliferation and invasion of cancer cells. Gli2 was identified as a downstream target of miR-218, and its expression was negatively regulated by miR-218. The thermo-chemotherapy induced miR-218 upregulation was also accompanied by increasing of E-cadherin expression. In conclusion, the present study indicates that thermo-chemotherapy can effectively decrease the invasion capability of cancer cells and increase cell-cell adhesion. miR-218 and its downstream target Gli2, as well as E-cadherin, participate in the anti-invasion process.

25703026	Title	The role of miR-100-mediated Notch pathway in apoptosis of gastric tumor cells.
25703026	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding regulatory molecules that influence many biological functions, including apoptosis, but their role in the regulation of apoptosis in gastric tumor cells has not been intensively investigated. Here, we showed that miR-100 was specifically upregulated in human epithelium-derived gastric cancer cells and that silencing miR-100 expression in human gastric epithelial cancer cells initiated a robust apoptotic response in vitro. Our in vivo assays indicated that the development of gastric cancer was inhibited by the miR-100 antagonism via initiating apoptosis of tumor. The results presented that antagonism of miR-100 increased the expression level of HS3ST2, the target gene of miR-100, and further resulted in the activation of the Notch-apoptosis pathway in tumor cells. The data also revealed that silencing of miR-100 expression sensitized gastric cancer cells to chemotherapy. Therefore our study presented a novel miR-100 mediated Notch pathway in apoptosis of tumor cells.

25706394	Title	MicroRNA-181a inhibits tumor proliferation, invasiveness, and metastasis and is downregulated in gastric cancer.
25706394	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in the development and progression of human cancers, including gastric cancer. The discovery of miRNAs may provide a new and powerful tool for studying the mechanism, diagnosis, and treatment of gastric cancer. Here we show that miR-181a levels were significantly downregulated in gastric cancer tissues compared with the adjacent normal regions in 80 paired samples. Moreover, the lower levels of miR-181a were associated with the pM or pTNM stage in clinical gastric cancer patients. In addition, the ectopic expression of miR-181a in the gastric cancer cell line HGC-27 inhibited cell proliferation, cell migration, and invasion by directly interacting with the mRNA encoding the oncogenic factor Prox1. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-181a might act as a tumor suppressor in gastric cancer, which may provide a novel diagnostic and therapeutic option for human gastric cancer in the near future.

25707493	Title	The miR-506-Induced Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition is Involved in Poor Prognosis for Patients with Gastric Cancer.
25707493	Abstract	MicroRNAs have roles in the regulation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Findings have shown that miR-506 inhibits the expression of SNAI2 and that low expression of miR-506 is associated with poor prognoses in ovarian and breast cancers. This study investigated the role of miR-506 in survival and the EMT in patients with gastric cancer. In this study, miR-506 and SNAI2 mRNA levels were measured in 141 cases of gastric cancer by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and the protein expressions of SNAI2 and E-cadherin in 39 cases were validated by immunohistochemical analysis. Next, the associations between their expression levels and clinicopathologic factors were evaluated. In addition, cell proliferation, migration, and luciferase activity of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of SNAI2 were analyzed using pre-miR-506 precursor in two human gastric cancer cell lines. Low expression of miR-506 was significantly correlated with poor overall survival in both the univariate analysis (P = 0.016) and the multivariate analysis (P < 0.05). Low miR-506 expression was significantly correlated with high SNAI2 expression (P = 0.009) and poorly differentiated type (P = 0.015). In vitro, miR-506 suppressed SNAI2 expression by binding to its 3'UTR, resulting in increased expression of E-cadherin (P < 0.05), verified by immunohistochemical analysis. Pre-miR-506 transfected cells showed significantly suppressed cell proliferation and migration (P < 0.05) compared with the control cells. The EMT was directly suppressed by miR-506, and its low expression was an independent prognostic factor in gastric cancer patients. The data indicated that miR-506 may act as a tumor suppressor and could be a novel therapeutic agent.

25743273	Title	Targeting of YAP1 by microRNA-15a and microRNA-16-1 exerts tumor suppressor function in gastric adenocarcinoma.
25743273	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to play an important role in tumorigenesis. In this study, the role of miR-15a and miR-16-1 in gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) was investigated. The expression of miR-15a and miR-16-1 in cell lines and primary tumors was examined by miRNA qRT-PCR. Proliferative assays, colony formation, cell invasion and migration, flow cytometry analysis and in vivo study were performed by ectopic expression of miR-15a and miR-16-1. The putative target genes of miR-15a and miR-16-1 were explored by TargetScan and further validated. We found that miR-15a and miR-16-1 were down-regulated in GAC cell lines and primary tumor samples compared with normal gastric epithelium. Functional study demonstrated that ectopic expression of miR-15a and miR-16-1 suppressed cell proliferation, monolayer colony formation, invasion and migration, and xenograft formation in vivo. In addition, miR-15a and miR-16-1 induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest which was further confirmed by Western blot and qRT-PCR of related cell cycle regulators. YAP1 was confirmed to be a functional target of miR-15a and miR-16-1 in GAC. YAP1 re-expression partly abrogated the inhibitory effect of miR-15a and miR-16-1 in GAC cells. In clinical samples, YAP1 protein expression shows negative correlation with miR-15a and miR-16-1 expression. In conclusion, targeting YAP1 by tumor suppressor miRNA miR-15a and miR-16-1 plays inhibitory effect and this might have a therapeutic potential in GAC.

25753202	Title	The role of microRNA-1274a in the tumorigenesis of gastric cancer: Accelerating cancer cell proliferation and migration via directly targeting FOXO4.
25753202	Abstract	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a series of 18-25 nucleotides length non-coding RNAs, which play critical roles in tumorigenesis. Previous study has shown that microRNA-1274a (miR-1274a) is upregulated in human gastric cancer. However, its role in gastric cancer progression remains poorly understood. Therefore, the current study was aimed to examine the effect of miR-1274a on gastric cancer cells. We found that miR-1274a was overexpressed in gastric cancer tissues or gastric cancer cells including HGC27, MGC803, AGS, and SGC-7901 by qRT-PCR analysis. Transfection of miR-1274a markedly promoted gastric cancer cells proliferation and migration as well as induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of cancer cells. Our further examination identified FOXO4 as a target of miR-1274a, which did not influence FOXO4 mRNA expression but significantly inhibited FOXO4 protein expression. Moreover, miR-1274a overexpression activated PI3K/Akt signaling and upregulated cyclin D1, MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions. With tumor xenografts in mice models, we also showed that miR-1274a promoted tumorigenesis of gastric cancer in vivo. In all, our study demonstrated that miR-1274a prompted gastric cancer cells growth and migration through dampening FOXO4 expression thus provided a potential target for human gastric cancer therapy.

25760688	Title	Inhibition of microRNA-17/20a suppresses cell proliferation in gastric cancer by modulating UBE2C expression.
25760688	Abstract	microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that potentially play a critical role in carcinogenesis. Increasing evidence indicates that the miR-17/20 cluster is upregulated in numerous types of human cancers including gastric cancer which suggests that the miR-17/20 cluster may play an important role in tumorigenesis. However, its role in gastric cancer carcinogenesis remains poorly defined due to the lack of target gene information. The aim of the present study was to investigate the target genes of the miR-17/20 cluster and their role in the tumor growth of gastric cancer. We found that both miR-17 and miR-20a (miR-17/20a) target the UBE2C gene in gastric cancer cells. Luciferase assay, qRT-PCR and western blot analysis confirmed that UBE2C is a direct target of miR‑17/20a in gastric cancer cells. Our results showed that the expression of UBE2C was positively regulated by miR-17/20a at both the mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, miR-17/20a was upregulated and positively associated with UBE2C in the gastric cancer tissues when compared to the adjacent nontumor tissues. Inhibition of miR-17/20a in gastric cancer cells was statistically correlated with a decrease in cell growth. These results demonstrate that upregulation of miR-17/20a promotes gastric cancer cell growth by targeting UBE2C and inhibition of their levels is a potentially promising therapeutic strategy for gastric cancer.

25762621	Title	miR-145 mediates the antiproliferative and gene regulatory effects of vitamin D3 by directly targeting E2F3 in gastric cancer cells.
25762621	Abstract	VitaminD3 signaling is involved in inhibiting the development and progression of gastric cancer (GC), while the active vitamin D metabolite 1-alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3)-mediated gene regulatory mechanisms in GC remain unclear. We found that miR-145 is induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in a dose- and vitamin D receptor (VDR)-dependent manner in GC cells. Inhibition of miR-145 reverses the antiproliferative effect of 1,25(OH)2D3. Furthermore, miR-145 expression was lower in tumors compared with matched normal samples and correlated with increased the E2F3 transcription factor protein staining. Overexpression of miR-145 inhibited colony formation, cell viability and induced cell arrest in S-phase in GC cells by targeting E2F3 and CDK6. miR-145 inhibition consistently abrogates the 1,25(OH)2D3-mediated suppression of E2F3, CDK6, CDK2 and CCNA2 genes. Altogether, our results indicate that miR-145 mediates the antiproliferative and gene regulatory effects of vitamin D3 in GC cells and might hold promise for prognosis and therapeutic strategies for GC treatment.
